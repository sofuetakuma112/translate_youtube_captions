0:04:33.680,0:04:37.919
going to do code insiders dot and that's

0:04:35.840,0:04:40.000
because i use the beta version okay so

0:04:37.919,0:04:42.400
that will go ahead and spin up a coding

0:04:40.000,0:04:44.160
environment for us right this is going

0:04:42.400,0:04:45.850

let's go down here let's go ahead and

0:08:16.240,0:08:20.240
hit the config now this is what we need

0:08:18.080,0:08:21.440
the firebase config over here right so

0:08:20.240,0:08:23.840
what i want to do is i'm going to copy

0:08:21.440,0:08:25.680
this now i'm going to jump over to my

0:08:23.840,0:08:27.440
code right so now obviously my code this

0:08:25.680,0:08:29.440
is not ideal i'm going to open up a

0:08:27.440,0:08:31.039
second desktop and you guys should get

0:08:29.440,0:08:31.919
familiar with setting up a flow like

0:08:31.039,0:08:34.320
this

0:08:31.919,0:08:36.000
okay so you want your flow to be very

0:08:34.320,0:08:37.680
efficient so this way i'm looking for my

0:08:36.000,0:08:39.599
firebase over here and i've got my code

0:08:37.680,0:08:41.279
editor over here perfect i don't need

0:08:39.599,0:08:43.279
the terminal anymore so i can close that

0:08:41.279,0:08:45.120
so at this point guys what i want to do

0:08:43.279,0:08:46.399
is i want to go to the source and before

0:08:45.120,0:08:49.760
we even do anything i'm going to add a

0:08:46.399,0:08:51.360
file called firebase.js

0:08:49.760,0:08:53.360
and remember that config over here that

0:08:51.360,0:08:55.600

is gonna be a hell of a lot of fun this

0:09:13.279,0:09:16.480
one i actually got really excited

0:09:14.720,0:09:18.560
because styled components is in this

0:09:16.480,0:09:20.399

and uh and guys trust me when i say this

0:09:22.480,0:09:26.560
code is clean

0:09:24.560,0:09:28.240
it is clean this is like one of the

0:09:26.560,0:09:30.720
cleanest bits of code i've written so

0:09:28.240,0:09:32.880
let's jump into this all right go ahead

0:09:30.720,0:09:35.519
over to app.js and what i want to do is

0:09:32.880,0:09:37.839
i don't need the app.test.js file logo

0:09:35.519,0:09:39.680
svg and setup test so this will freeze

0:09:37.839,0:09:41.680
my computer because if my loyal

0:09:39.680,0:09:43.120
followers know i can't delete stuff and

0:09:41.680,0:09:45.200
without it dying so i'm going to move to

0:09:43.120,0:09:47.440
trash and we're just going to oh wow

0:09:45.200,0:09:49.360
it actually worked

0:09:47.440,0:09:51.120
people like going on papa fam will know

0:09:49.360,0:09:53.120
that that's been a struggle all right

0:09:51.120,0:09:54.959
let's carry on nice so what we're going

0:09:53.120,0:09:57.440
to do here is grab everything inside the

0:09:54.959,0:09:59.200
header and boom i'm going to type in h1

0:09:57.440,0:10:01.200
and let's say let's build slack let's

0:09:59.200,0:10:02.640
build slack boom and then i'm going to

0:10:01.200,0:10:04.160
go ahead and delete these two lines

0:10:02.640,0:10:05.839
right here we don't need the counter we

0:10:04.160,0:10:07.600
don't need the logo and i'm going to

0:10:05.839,0:10:10.079
change this to a lowercase a however

0:10:07.600,0:10:11.600
we're going to be using um we're not

0:10:10.079,0:10:12.959
using bem today we're using style

0:10:11.600,0:10:15.040
components so it's going to be a lot of

0:10:12.959,0:10:17.200
fun right a hell of a lot of fun now

0:10:15.040,0:10:18.959
what i want to do is command j right on

0:10:17.200,0:10:20.720
jay open up my terminal

0:10:18.959,0:10:21.839
and while everything's working we're

0:10:20.720,0:10:23.360
going to go ahead and click this

0:10:21.839,0:10:24.399
features over here now i want you guys

0:10:23.360,0:10:25.920
to pay

0:10:24.399,0:10:28.959
like very close attention to what i'm

0:10:25.920,0:10:31.440
about to do okay so inside of features

0:10:28.959,0:10:33.839
right we have counter slice now what i

0:10:31.440,0:10:36.160
want you to do is grab counter slice and

0:10:33.839,0:10:37.920
drag it on top of features because

0:10:36.160,0:10:39.839
what's actually happened is it's inside

0:10:37.920,0:10:41.360
of a folder called counter okay so i

0:10:39.839,0:10:42.880
want you to drag counter slice on top of

0:10:41.360,0:10:45.360
features click move

0:10:42.880,0:10:47.120
now you can see it's outside the counter

0:10:45.360,0:10:49.440
folder so at this point i want you to

0:10:47.120,0:10:51.040
right click on counter and click delete

0:10:49.440,0:10:53.120
right we don't want the counter folder

0:10:51.040,0:10:56.320
anymore okay perfect now we have counter

0:10:53.120,0:10:59.040
slice and this is all part of redux okay

0:10:56.320,0:11:01.040
so everything here is part of redux and

0:10:59.040,0:11:04.079
i really love nj dave's comment here he

0:11:01.040,0:11:05.680
says repetition is the best way to learn

0:11:04.079,0:11:07.279
and dude i completely agree with you

0:11:05.680,0:11:09.519
honestly i completely agree with you

0:11:07.279,0:11:10.800
repetition is the way to go right at

0:11:09.519,0:11:13.600
this point we're going to get an error

0:11:10.800,0:11:15.519
so i want to go into my app store.js and

0:11:13.600,0:11:19.760
here because we got rid of that counter

0:11:15.519,0:11:21.600
folder i need to go here and say

0:11:19.760,0:11:23.600
boom get rid of that so it's features

0:11:21.600,0:11:25.440
forward slash counter slice now we will

0:11:23.600,0:11:28.880
be renaming this in a bit but we'll come

0:11:25.440,0:11:30.560
back to redux in a second okay so

0:11:28.880,0:11:32.480
delete through the terminal says robert

0:11:30.560,0:11:34.079
hey i have actually done that before

0:11:32.480,0:11:36.560
it's actually quicker

0:11:34.079,0:11:38.480
says dad i can donate here paypal give

app.js and here inside the terminal i'm

0:11:49.839,0:11:53.839
going to go ahead and type in yarn start

0:11:52.320,0:11:55.920
because we're using yarn today because

0:11:53.839,0:11:58.240
that's what we do now right before we

0:11:55.920,0:12:00.399
used to use npm but you know i started

0:11:58.240,0:12:01.839
to enjoy the the yarn side of things

0:12:00.399,0:12:04.079

this as a reference and then i'm going

0:13:05.200,0:13:09.680
to be building a fresh app out of this

0:13:07.760,0:13:11.760
right so now i'm going to go over and

0:13:09.680,0:13:13.040
while this is loading give it one second

0:13:11.760,0:13:15.120

0:14:00.399,0:14:04.399
everyone's asking about why i've left cp

0:14:02.480,0:14:06.160
uh guys this i don't need a reason i

0:14:04.399,0:14:07.839
just don't want to i want to kind of

0:14:06.160,0:14:10.320
carry on in my own route and i've built

0:14:07.839,0:14:12.240
i feel like i can deliver actual value

0:14:10.320,0:14:14.320
here in the way that i feel is most

0:14:12.240,0:14:16.560
efficient okay and plus we've got the

0:14:14.320,0:14:18.480
pup of fam guys like

0:14:16.560,0:14:20.240
get with it right let's carry on

0:14:18.480,0:14:21.920
let's go let's build a slack all right

0:14:20.240,0:14:23.600
so the first thing we want to do right

0:14:21.920,0:14:25.199
this is going to be a slightly different

0:14:23.600,0:14:26.959
tutorial right so the first thing we

0:14:25.199,0:14:28.560
want to do is we will be using react

0:14:26.959,0:14:30.240
router in today's build right so that

0:14:28.560,0:14:32.240
way we can have pagering inside of our

0:14:30.240,0:14:34.399
application so

0:14:32.240,0:14:35.920
a lot a lot of fun in today's build okay

0:14:34.399,0:14:37.680
and guys we're almost at 200 likes to

0:14:35.920,0:14:41.040
smash the likes let's get them up right

0:14:37.680,0:14:42.959
we were at 200 before it even started so

0:14:41.040,0:14:44.480
this is gonna be a fresh one the first

0:14:42.959,0:14:46.800
stream went down but we are not going to

0:14:44.480,0:14:47.760
let this one beat us okay so first thing

0:14:46.800,0:14:50.240
we're going to do is i'm going to go

0:14:47.760,0:14:52.079
ahead and install react to router so i'm

0:14:50.240,0:14:54.560
going to go over here and say react

0:14:52.079,0:14:56.160
router in google okay we're going to

0:14:54.560,0:14:58.240
wait till this loads out and then i'm

0:14:56.160,0:14:59.279
going to go to the react rear docks

0:14:58.240,0:15:01.040
right

0:14:59.279,0:15:03.760
and let's see

0:15:01.040,0:15:05.440
and let's click on declarative routing

0:15:03.760,0:15:07.440
for react.js

0:15:05.440,0:15:09.600
and this way a sag

0:15:07.440,0:15:10.639
there we go the stream's perfectly fine

0:15:09.600,0:15:12.959
at this point

0:15:10.639,0:15:14.800
jump over to twitch if you're having any

0:15:12.959,0:15:16.720
issues so at this point we can go ahead

0:15:14.800,0:15:19.120
and we're going to copy this we need to

0:15:16.720,0:15:21.199
install reactor or dom okay so i'm going

0:15:19.120,0:15:23.279
to copy this go back to my app and i

0:15:21.199,0:15:25.040
like to have a split terminal

0:15:23.279,0:15:26.800
so a lot of people don't like to have

0:15:25.040,0:15:28.800
sort of split there the second one i

0:15:26.800,0:15:30.560
like to have a split terminal because

0:15:28.800,0:15:32.160
then i can see both things at once but

0:15:30.560,0:15:33.759
what i do is i make this one smaller

0:15:32.160,0:15:36.079
okay so that way i can see everything

0:15:33.759,0:15:37.839
here i'll say yarn add and i'll do react

0:15:36.079,0:15:39.120
with dom boom okay

0:15:37.839,0:15:40.959
mohammed says i love you sonny you're

0:15:39.120,0:15:43.040
just amazing thank you dude what's up

0:15:40.959,0:15:45.279
assad good to see you man

0:15:43.040,0:15:47.279
right so we're installing reactor dom so

0:15:45.279,0:15:48.720
now we have reactor inside our app the

0:15:47.279,0:15:50.720
easiest way to get this up and running

0:15:48.720,0:15:52.560
go ahead copy the import statements

0:15:50.720,0:15:53.839
let's go ahead and pop this in right

0:15:52.560,0:15:56.079
here

0:15:53.839,0:15:57.839
boom copy and let's go ahead and paste

0:15:56.079,0:15:59.440
it over here and then what i'm going to

0:15:57.839,0:16:01.199
do is i'm going to grab everything

0:15:59.440,0:16:03.759
inside of router

0:16:01.199,0:16:05.839
there we go and then this jump over here

0:16:03.759,0:16:07.600
right so

0:16:05.839,0:16:09.920
a towel says hey sonny can we use react

0:16:07.600,0:16:11.120
hooks over redux of course you can let's

0:16:09.920,0:16:12.880
go ahead and paste it inside of here

0:16:11.120,0:16:14.880
right and i'm going to get rid of my h1

0:16:12.880,0:16:16.880
over here so at this point if we save

0:16:14.880,0:16:18.399
our application you should be able to

0:16:16.880,0:16:20.399
see what i see at this point right so

0:16:18.399,0:16:22.240
we've got a router and what we want to

0:16:20.399,0:16:23.759
do is everything inside the nav we don't

0:16:22.240,0:16:25.279
want that okay i don't really care about

0:16:23.759,0:16:27.440
all that stuff right now we don't care

0:16:25.279,0:16:29.199
about that right then the thing that i

0:16:27.440,0:16:30.000
need next is i'm going to change this

0:16:29.199,0:16:32.160
div

0:16:30.000,0:16:33.279
into an actual just a fragment okay

0:16:32.160,0:16:34.639
because i actually don't need that div

0:16:33.279,0:16:35.759
at this point i'm going to get rid of

0:16:34.639,0:16:38.320
this comment

0:16:35.759,0:16:40.720
now what is a react router okay so react

0:16:38.320,0:16:42.399
router allows us to have different pages

0:16:40.720,0:16:43.759
on our website so if we go to forward

0:16:42.399,0:16:45.680
slash it will take us to this home

0:16:43.759,0:16:47.440
component if we go to four slash users

0:16:45.680,0:16:49.040
it will take us to the user's component

0:16:47.440,0:16:50.480
and if we go to forward slash about will

0:16:49.040,0:16:52.720
take us to the about component now we

0:16:50.480,0:16:55.040
don't have these pages so for now i'm

0:16:52.720,0:16:56.959
gonna go ahead and get rid of them okay

0:16:55.040,0:16:59.440
so at this point i'm gonna go ahead and

0:16:56.959,0:17:01.519
do this uh harsh please don't spam dude

0:16:59.440,0:17:03.920
i will be sending out right so i'm gonna

0:17:01.519,0:17:06.640
go ahead and say h1 and let's just say

0:17:03.920,0:17:08.240
this is the home page and just to make

0:17:06.640,0:17:10.480
it extremely clear now when we're on the

0:17:08.240,0:17:12.720
home page what will happen is i'm going

0:17:10.480,0:17:14.240
to make it firstly an exact

0:17:12.720,0:17:16.319
route which means you have to land on

0:17:14.240,0:17:18.000
the home page only and now if we go back

0:17:16.319,0:17:19.919
to our application let's go ahead and

0:17:18.000,0:17:22.720
check it out it says this is the home

0:17:19.919,0:17:24.559
page okay perfect stuff works just as we

0:17:22.720,0:17:26.880
expected it so now we have a react

0:17:24.559,0:17:28.799
router set up your garage said i

0:18:02.080,0:18:06.480
now we've got the homepage here so what

0:18:03.679,0:18:08.600
we need to do now app.css clear

0:18:06.480,0:18:11.200
everything we don't want anything go to

0:18:08.600,0:18:12.799
index.css and at the top i want to do

0:18:11.200,0:18:15.200
the following i want to say target

0:18:12.799,0:18:16.320
everything with a margin of zero

0:18:15.200,0:18:17.440
and what i'm going to do is you guys

0:18:16.320,0:18:19.840
love when i do this i'm going to go

0:18:17.440,0:18:21.919
ahead and pop this on one side and pop

0:18:19.840,0:18:23.120
the co the actual application on the

0:18:21.919,0:18:24.720
other side so let's go ahead and pop

0:18:23.120,0:18:27.039
this over here

0:18:24.720,0:18:28.720
perfect so now you guys can see i've got

0:18:27.039,0:18:30.400
if i go ahead and add this

0:18:28.720,0:18:31.440
margin of zero you guys should be able

0:18:30.400,0:18:34.080
to see let me go ahead and get rid of

0:18:31.440,0:18:35.679
that you see this little imaginary gap

0:18:34.080,0:18:37.280
over here right this is going to go

0:18:35.679,0:18:39.679
ahead and disappear when we add a margin

0:18:37.280,0:18:40.880
of zero so if i go ahead and save you

0:18:39.679,0:18:43.039
can see boom it gets rid of the

0:18:40.880,0:18:44.799
imaginary gap okay so that's the first

0:18:43.039,0:18:46.559
step that we wanted to do the second

0:18:44.799,0:18:48.559
step i actually want to do is i'm going

0:18:46.559,0:18:50.880
to set something in body today right i'm

0:18:48.559,0:18:53.360
going to set a css variable now css

0:18:50.880,0:18:54.799
variable is a very similar to a

0:18:53.360,0:18:56.559
javascript variable pretty much it just

0:18:54.799,0:18:59.280
holds the value okay so what we're going

0:18:56.559,0:19:00.960
to do is i'm going to have a slack color

0:18:59.280,0:19:02.400
right css variable and this is how we

0:19:00.960,0:19:04.240
define it right we pretty much just say

0:19:02.400,0:19:06.400
slack color and then we do this we just

0:19:04.240,0:19:09.120
give it the color and now we can go

0:19:06.400,0:19:10.640
ahead and access the slack color like so

0:19:09.120,0:19:12.000
okay and then what i'm going to do is

0:19:10.640,0:19:13.280
i'm going to go ahead and say overflow

0:19:12.000,0:19:14.640
hidden that way in case we have any

0:19:13.280,0:19:16.080
overflow inside of our app we're going

0:19:14.640,0:19:18.400
to hide it okay so i'm just going to

0:19:16.080,0:19:20.400
protect myself later on so now boom get

0:19:18.400,0:19:22.799
rid of that and then get rid of that now

0:19:20.400,0:19:24.160
we're back inside of app.js so firstly

0:19:22.799,0:19:25.600
i'm going to mark out the application

0:19:24.160,0:19:27.679
okay so let's look at the final

0:19:25.600,0:19:29.120
application and see what we got to do so

0:19:27.679,0:19:30.480
we have a few things in this build right

0:19:29.120,0:19:32.480
we have the header so we have this

0:19:30.480,0:19:34.559
beautiful header over here okay we have

0:19:32.480,0:19:37.039
a nice looking header we have a sidebar

0:19:34.559,0:19:40.160
over here we have a chat input component

0:19:37.039,0:19:42.000
we have the chat itself over here and we

0:19:40.160,0:19:43.360
also have the login stuff right so if i

0:19:42.000,0:19:45.280
want to go ahead go ahead and go back

0:19:43.360,0:19:46.080
here we have the login page

0:19:45.280,0:19:48.320
so

0:19:46.080,0:19:50.240
what i might do first is actually build

0:19:48.320,0:19:51.760
maybe the uh

0:19:50.240,0:19:53.120
let's build let's start building the app

0:20:34.240,0:20:39.039
home page over here right so what i'm

0:20:36.000,0:20:40.320
going to do now is for the home page

0:20:39.039,0:20:43.039
i'm going to go ahead and actually

0:20:40.320,0:20:45.120
firstly let's go ahead and do the

0:20:43.039,0:20:46.080
the header component okay so i'm going

0:20:45.120,0:20:48.000
to go ahead and set up a header

0:20:46.080,0:20:49.760
component so over here i'm gonna go

0:20:48.000,0:20:53.039
ahead and say okay the header will go

0:20:49.760,0:20:54.480
here the header like so right so what i

0:20:53.039,0:20:56.400
need to do is obviously create a header

0:20:54.480,0:20:58.880
component so i'm gonna say header

0:20:56.400,0:21:01.919
dot js now i'm using snippets okay so

0:20:58.880,0:21:03.919
i'm using rfce allows me to create a

0:21:01.919,0:21:05.600
functional component how did i do that

0:21:03.919,0:21:06.960
in case you're new to the channel go to

0:21:05.600,0:21:10.000
extensions and you want to make sure you

0:21:06.960,0:21:11.840
get this extension right here es7 react

0:21:10.000,0:21:13.600
redux graphql react native snippets they

0:21:11.840,0:21:16.159
are incredible okay really really

0:21:13.600,0:21:18.320
incredible stuff and uh yeah just make

million 2 million 2.3 2.4 million wow

0:21:22.159,0:21:26.720
crazy stuff right let's carry on so at

0:21:24.799,0:21:28.080
this point we've got the header okay so

0:21:26.720,0:21:29.679
let's jump into the header and see what

0:21:28.080,0:21:31.120
we need so the first thing i'm going to

0:21:29.679,0:21:32.799
need inside the header is let's have a

0:21:31.120,0:21:34.159
look at it we have a header left section

0:21:32.799,0:21:36.000
so i'm going to assume that this is my

0:21:34.159,0:21:38.080

0:21:39.919,0:21:43.600
this little icon over here now how do i

0:21:41.760,0:21:46.400
get these icons right i need something

0:21:43.600,0:21:48.080
called material ui right so i'm going to

0:23:05.520,0:23:09.440
throughout the builds okay now guys

0:23:07.200,0:23:11.120
we're almost at 200 likes smash that

0:23:09.440,0:23:12.960
thumbs up button to help this video get

0:23:11.120,0:23:14.159

going to be a hell of a lot of fun today

0:23:14.159,0:23:18.400
guys let's carry on right we would have

0:23:16.000,0:23:20.000
been a 400 if that's stupid internet

0:23:18.400,0:23:21.440
right but it's fine we're all good we're

0:23:20.000,0:23:23.360
stronger than this i think we can keep

0:23:21.440,0:23:24.320
pushing i really think we can keep going

0:23:23.360,0:23:25.840
right

0:23:24.320,0:23:26.799
so at this point i'm gonna go ahead and

0:23:25.840,0:23:28.720
say

0:23:26.799,0:23:31.679
um close this because we've already got

0:23:28.720,0:23:33.919
that right so we have the header now i'm

0:23:31.679,0:23:36.799
gonna be using styled components now

0:23:33.919,0:23:39.280
what are styled components okay styled

0:23:36.799,0:23:41.360
components are simply put we're not

0:23:39.280,0:23:43.279
going to be using css in this in the

0:23:41.360,0:23:44.960
traditional way where we import a css

0:23:43.279,0:23:46.720
file and then we kind of you know we

0:23:44.960,0:23:49.200
style out some stuff and we use the bem

0:23:46.720,0:23:51.200
naming convention typically where a div

0:23:49.200,0:23:52.960
has a class name and then we sort of

0:23:51.200,0:23:54.559
target the class name but today we're

0:23:52.960,0:23:55.600
changing things right we're changing it

0:23:54.559,0:23:57.360
up we're going to be using something

0:23:55.600,0:23:58.960
called start components now i want to

0:23:57.360,0:24:01.200
show you what style components are all

0:23:58.960,0:24:03.039
about why they're so popular okay so

0:24:01.200,0:24:06.159
start components they have pretty much

0:24:03.039,0:24:07.520
the power behind um

0:24:06.159,0:24:10.000
they're pretty much more powerful than

0:24:07.520,0:24:12.000
css modules they do a lot of head like

0:24:10.000,0:24:14.000
uh of heavy lifting for you behind the

0:24:12.000,0:24:15.840
scenes and they make your app extremely

0:24:14.000,0:24:17.600
fast now if you're wondering who uses it

0:24:15.840,0:24:19.520
just check out this list right tons of

0:24:17.600,0:24:22.880
places use this thing right so all these

0:24:19.520,0:24:23.760
folks use it vimeo vogue

0:24:22.880,0:24:25.440
uh

0:24:23.760,0:24:28.240
the onion i don't know what that is but

0:24:28.240,0:24:32.080
get that dodge coin guys get right and

0:24:30.640,0:24:34.080
this is pretty much how we define it you

0:24:32.080,0:24:36.000
pretty much use define a variable so

0:24:34.080,0:24:37.919
imagine we wanted to find a button and

0:24:36.000,0:24:39.279
then you pretty much say style dot and

0:24:37.919,0:24:41.520
then you give this sort of if it was a

0:24:39.279,0:24:43.679
div here i'd say div and then you pretty

0:24:41.520,0:24:45.279
much give some css inside of it now

0:24:43.679,0:24:46.640
trust me it's not as tricky as you think

0:24:45.279,0:24:48.000
okay it's really not that tricky i'm

0:24:46.640,0:24:49.679

0:25:07.679,0:25:12.400
ahead and grab start components here i'm

0:25:09.679,0:25:14.559

gwen says i love the fact that we can

0:25:17.600,0:25:21.200
actually pause the video

0:25:19.360,0:25:22.400
and i'm gonna go to the bottom okay so

0:25:21.200,0:25:25.120
to make sure i'm at the bottom i go to

0:25:22.400,0:25:27.039
the second last tag comma and i'm gonna

0:25:25.120,0:25:28.799
go ahead and paste so you see resolution

0:25:27.039,0:25:30.159
styled components right so it's very

0:25:28.799,0:25:32.159
simple thing you just need to copy what

0:25:30.159,0:25:35.120
i just did there okay 200 likes that's

0:25:32.159,0:25:36.960
what i'm talking about guys see we had

0:25:35.120,0:25:39.200
issues with the internet we didn't let

0:25:36.960,0:25:41.360
that stop us papa fam is way stronger

0:25:39.200,0:25:43.600

right i'm going to hit save on that and

0:25:45.039,0:25:48.720
it's still installing styled components

0:25:46.720,0:25:50.480
so we can give that just to sex and uh

0:25:48.720,0:25:51.679
be patient with that one right and you

0:25:50.480,0:25:53.600
can see pretty much after that we can

0:25:51.679,0:25:56.799
just use them okay so we're going to use

0:25:53.600,0:25:58.960
that firstly inside of the uh inside of

0:25:56.799,0:26:00.559
our header component and trust me guys

0:25:58.960,0:26:02.000
it will make a lot of sense when we jump

0:26:00.559,0:26:03.840
into this and when we start running with

0:26:02.000,0:26:05.600
it okay so we're gonna pretty much just

0:26:03.840,0:26:06.640
okay we're gonna get get ready for this

0:26:05.600,0:26:08.799
okay

0:26:06.640,0:26:13.200
um so let's carry on guys

0:26:08.799,0:26:14.000
and uh what we're gonna do now is

0:26:13.200,0:26:16.640

0:26:14.000,0:26:18.240
so please don't spam dude i hate it when

0:26:16.640,0:26:19.679
people spam like i'm actually gonna

0:26:18.240,0:26:23.360
block people from this channel if you

0:26:19.679,0:26:25.360
spam so ayushman dude you're out right

0:26:23.360,0:26:26.720
let's go so um

0:26:25.360,0:26:28.000
what we're gonna it was installing the

0:26:26.720,0:26:29.840
style components that's why i was kind

0:26:28.000,0:26:32.159
of freaking out so at this point we have

0:26:29.840,0:26:34.159
style components installed okay so what

0:26:32.159,0:26:36.159
we're gonna do is is we're gonna go here

0:26:34.159,0:26:37.840
and even this one dude wow so many

0:26:36.159,0:26:39.919
people are spamming dude so any

0:26:37.840,0:26:41.600
moderator so pranav do you mind just

0:26:39.919,0:26:43.279
sort of you know you can time out people

0:26:41.600,0:26:45.200
i'll give you permission go ahead and

0:26:43.279,0:26:47.760
just clean up that chat right so over

0:26:45.200,0:26:50.480
here what we're gonna do is i'm gonna go

0:26:47.760,0:26:52.559
ahead and rather than having divs right

0:26:50.480,0:26:53.840
this is how we use styled components

0:26:52.559,0:26:54.960
okay so i'm going to make this a little

0:26:53.840,0:26:57.200
bit bigger for you guys i think that

0:26:54.960,0:26:59.279
might be easier for you to see so how do

0:26:57.200,0:27:00.960
we go ahead and use a testing is we

0:26:59.279,0:27:02.400
don't have a css file which is really

0:27:00.960,0:27:04.320
nice in that sense okay we get rid of

0:27:02.400,0:27:06.320
the css file now what we do is it

0:27:04.320,0:27:07.760
actually lives underneath oh which is

0:27:06.320,0:27:08.960
really nice in that sense okay that's

0:27:07.760,0:27:11.440
the sort of standard that we should be

0:27:08.960,0:27:13.360
doing okay so it should live underneath

0:27:11.440,0:27:14.320
the uh the stream over there so at this

0:27:13.360,0:27:16.080
point

0:27:14.320,0:27:17.440
what we're gonna do is we're gonna go

0:27:16.080,0:27:18.960
ahead and say

0:27:17.440,0:27:21.440
let's go ahead and have a header

0:27:18.960,0:27:25.279
container okay so i'm going to say const

0:27:21.440,0:27:27.520
header container like this okay equals

0:27:25.279,0:27:30.080
styled right because it's styled

0:27:27.520,0:27:31.360
components which we have to import oh no

0:27:30.080,0:27:32.960
it's not that one oops not that

0:27:31.360,0:27:33.840
definitely not that one right what we're

0:27:32.960,0:27:34.960
going to do instead we're going to

0:27:33.840,0:27:37.360
import it and we're going to go ahead

0:27:34.960,0:27:40.640
and say import styled from styled

0:27:37.360,0:27:42.960
components like this we say style.div

0:27:40.640,0:27:45.440
okay now here what we need to do is go

0:27:42.960,0:27:47.600
ahead and do backticks so these are not

0:27:45.440,0:27:49.919
regular ticks guys okay so they're back

0:27:47.600,0:27:51.679
ticks okay you do back ticks and then

0:27:49.919,0:27:53.520
what you want to do is start styling it

0:27:51.679,0:27:56.399
okay so let's just say imagine the color

0:27:53.520,0:27:59.279
of the text here was red okay so we said

0:27:56.399,0:28:01.760
color let's just say red

0:27:59.279,0:28:03.200
okay so these are back ticks etc let's

0:28:01.760,0:28:04.799
go ahead and do that

0:28:03.200,0:28:06.880
and then oops i need to go ahead mine

0:28:04.799,0:28:08.320
has like nice syntax highlighting okay

0:28:06.880,0:28:10.480
and you might be wondering but sunny

0:28:08.320,0:28:12.799
mine looks a bit like this right

0:28:10.480,0:28:14.000
everything is this color now what you

0:28:12.799,0:28:16.080
need to do

0:28:14.000,0:28:17.760
okay is you need to go ahead and guys if

0:28:16.080,0:28:20.559
anyone's having issues with the internet

0:28:17.760,0:28:22.240
pretty much just go ahead and uh refresh

0:28:20.559,0:28:24.640
your browser and it should be all good

0:28:22.240,0:28:26.559

we're gonna go ahead and i'm just gonna

0:28:31.679,0:28:35.840
play my music instead of doing the uh

0:28:34.080,0:28:37.039
the other one okay there we go so at

0:28:35.840,0:28:39.360
this point what we're gonna do is go

0:28:37.039,0:28:41.919
ahead and jump over to

0:28:39.360,0:28:44.080
your extensions okay so over here in the

0:28:41.919,0:28:46.320

0:28:56.799,0:29:01.919
syntax highlighting for your styled

0:29:00.240,0:29:04.880
components without it it's going to be a

0:29:01.919,0:29:06.880
bit of a headache okay and uh guys if

0:29:04.880,0:29:07.919
anyone asks why i'm not with cp anymore

0:29:06.880,0:29:10.640
i'm just going to block you honestly

0:29:07.919,0:29:13.120
it's really annoying uh guys i'm i

0:29:10.640,0:29:15.360
deliver more value over here period and

0:29:13.120,0:29:16.480
we've got you know chill out all right

0:29:15.360,0:29:17.840
let's carry on

0:29:16.480,0:29:19.679
right so i'm going to go ahead and get

0:29:17.840,0:29:21.520
rid of this one the stream has not ended

0:29:19.679,0:29:23.200
you can just refresh dude all right so

0:29:21.520,0:29:24.080
at this point where we have the header

0:29:23.200,0:29:25.600
okay so what i'm going to do is i'm

0:29:24.080,0:29:26.960
going to say header

0:29:25.600,0:29:27.760
container

0:29:26.960,0:29:30.159
okay

0:29:27.760,0:29:32.559
and now you can see what's happened is

0:29:30.159,0:29:34.320
this is simply got these styles injected

0:29:32.559,0:29:35.440
into it so now if i have a h1 which says

0:29:34.320,0:29:37.760
test

0:29:35.440,0:29:39.279
okay and i go into my app.js and i

0:29:37.760,0:29:40.480
import the header

0:29:39.279,0:29:42.080
like so

0:29:40.480,0:29:43.840
and i save i'm going to go ahead and pop

0:29:42.080,0:29:46.399
this to the side and let's go ahead and

0:29:43.840,0:29:47.919
go back over here okay now

0:29:46.399,0:29:49.360
inside of here you can see what the

0:29:47.919,0:29:51.120
really cool thing about this right is if

0:29:49.360,0:29:53.360
i go ahead and say background color

0:29:51.120,0:29:54.880
let's do background color red and then

0:29:53.360,0:29:57.600
i'm going to go ahead and refresh let me

0:29:54.880,0:29:59.679
see my header container is a style div

0:29:57.600,0:30:01.520
there we go the background color is red

0:29:59.679,0:30:03.200
um interesting okay let's double check

0:30:01.520,0:30:04.559
what's going on here but what we want to

0:30:03.200,0:30:05.919
do is let's just start jumping into

0:30:04.559,0:30:07.520
actually the coding aspect of it oh

0:30:05.919,0:30:08.559
there we go that's why

0:30:07.520,0:30:10.320
um

0:30:08.559,0:30:12.480
okay i know why so at this point imagine

0:30:10.320,0:30:14.000
i want to target that h1 what i need to

0:30:12.480,0:30:16.559
do is i just go ahead and say okay

0:30:14.000,0:30:18.720
target the h1 inside of here and give it

0:30:16.559,0:30:20.320
a color of red so let's go ahead and do

0:30:18.720,0:30:21.600
color of red

0:30:20.320,0:30:24.480
like this save

0:30:21.600,0:30:26.720
right and this will go ahead and uh this

0:30:24.480,0:30:27.679
will actually this will do it right it's

0:30:26.720,0:30:28.960
actually i'm not sure why it's not

0:30:27.679,0:30:30.720
rendering let's double check what's

0:30:28.960,0:30:31.840
happening over here

0:30:30.720,0:30:34.000
right

0:30:31.840,0:30:36.399
so what i would recommend is if you do

0:30:34.000,0:30:37.679
experience any of these issues ctrl c

0:30:36.399,0:30:39.679
and then you're gonna do yarn start

0:30:37.679,0:30:41.120
again okay the reason why this is

0:30:39.679,0:30:43.120
happening is because we've installed

0:30:41.120,0:30:44.480
style components we need to make sure

0:30:43.120,0:30:47.760
that we go ahead and restart our

0:30:44.480,0:30:49.440
terminal i'm gonna do y 3001

0:30:47.760,0:30:51.679
and then we'll wait for this to start up

0:30:49.440,0:30:54.000
again

0:30:51.679,0:30:54.000
okay

0:30:55.120,0:31:00.320
right and i'm gonna go ahead and refresh

0:30:58.640,0:31:02.320
save

0:31:00.320,0:31:04.960
perfect now style div okay i'm gonna say

0:31:02.320,0:31:06.480
color let's just say green

0:31:04.960,0:31:07.760
and then let's go ahead and pop it in

0:31:06.480,0:31:08.799
perfect

0:31:07.760,0:31:10.000
and

0:31:08.799,0:31:11.519
now

0:31:10.000,0:31:13.120
we'll go ahead and we'll fix this in a

0:31:11.519,0:31:14.960
sec okay i'm not sure exactly what i've

0:31:13.120,0:31:16.240
done here but uh let's go ahead and

0:31:14.960,0:31:18.240
carry on i'm gonna carry on with the

0:31:16.240,0:31:19.679
build and then we'll fix this okay so we

0:31:18.240,0:31:21.039
have the header container right now the

0:31:19.679,0:31:22.320
header container is gonna have a bunch

0:31:21.039,0:31:24.559
of style inside of it but as we

0:31:22.320,0:31:26.960
mentioned before we have a header left

0:31:24.559,0:31:28.320
section okay so inside of here i'm gonna

0:31:26.960,0:31:30.640
have a header left so let's go ahead and

0:31:28.320,0:31:32.000
say like a header left

0:31:30.640,0:31:33.039
uh we're gonna have a header right and

0:31:32.000,0:31:34.880
i'm gonna show you guys what i'm

0:31:33.039,0:31:37.039
referring to here so imagine our local

0:31:34.880,0:31:38.399
host 3000 so this is our actual slack

0:31:37.039,0:31:40.720
app i'll show you how to do that cool

0:31:38.399,0:31:41.919
stuff as well we'll say header middle or

0:31:40.720,0:31:43.760
sort of header search we'll call the

0:31:41.919,0:31:45.760
middle one

0:31:43.760,0:31:48.159
all right head to search and then we'll

0:31:45.760,0:31:50.480
have header right okay

0:31:48.159,0:31:51.279
header right

0:31:50.480,0:31:53.200
right

0:31:51.279,0:31:55.120
now

0:31:53.200,0:31:58.000
is green not green

0:31:55.120,0:32:00.559
oh okay really oh wait a sec no that

0:31:58.000,0:32:02.000
shouldn't be the reason right color

0:32:00.559,0:32:04.000
green

0:32:02.000,0:32:05.360
oh dude you're right yeah you're

0:32:04.000,0:32:06.799
actually right let's go ahead and do

0:32:05.360,0:32:09.120
that boom

0:32:06.799,0:32:11.200
there we go and it will actually pop in

0:32:09.120,0:32:12.720
now so if we go into h1

0:32:11.200,0:32:14.640
just

0:32:12.720,0:32:16.640
save there we go that's correct yeah

0:32:14.640,0:32:19.039
you're right my bad nice shout out

0:32:16.640,0:32:20.080
daniel good [ __ ] all right so let's go

0:32:19.039,0:32:21.760
ahead and carry on so there you go you

0:32:20.080,0:32:24.080
see it applies the style to that div

0:32:21.760,0:32:25.440
okay so we have three sections over here

0:32:24.080,0:32:27.120
so what are we referring to at this

0:32:25.440,0:32:28.720
point header left is going to be the

0:32:27.120,0:32:30.000
left section we've got the middle

0:32:28.720,0:32:31.120
section which is going to be the search

0:32:30.000,0:32:33.120
and then we've got the right section

0:32:31.120,0:32:36.320
over here so let's go ahead and jump

0:32:33.120,0:32:37.760
through okay so

0:32:36.320,0:32:39.519
header left

0:32:37.760,0:32:40.960
first thing we're going to do is create

0:32:39.519,0:32:43.679
a constant we're going to say header

0:32:40.960,0:32:47.039
left so i'm going to go and say const

0:32:43.679,0:32:49.519
header left like so equals a star div

0:32:47.039,0:32:52.159
right and remember you if you want a h1

0:32:49.519,0:32:54.559
or h2 you can just say style dot h2 and

0:32:52.159,0:32:56.480
it works in that way as well right so uh

0:32:54.559,0:32:58.559
that's actually really cool uh are you

0:32:56.480,0:32:59.919
schmann dude you continue to spam so

0:32:58.559,0:33:02.240
dude like i'm hiding you from the

0:32:59.919,0:33:04.880
channel now i've i warned once and then

0:33:02.240,0:33:06.480
it just continued to continue spam dude

0:33:04.880,0:33:07.600
so you're out all right so let's go

0:33:06.480,0:33:08.960
ahead and carry out we've got the header

0:33:07.600,0:33:11.360
left so we're gonna go ahead and create

0:33:08.960,0:33:13.440
a header left section over here and this

0:33:11.360,0:33:15.440
is actually very clean guys because if

0:33:13.440,0:33:18.159
think about it this way your css is

0:33:15.440,0:33:19.519
never going to go ahead and overlap okay

0:33:18.159,0:33:21.919
it's never going to overlap which is

0:33:19.519,0:33:24.720
amazing if you do it this way whereas

0:33:21.919,0:33:27.200
css by itself can easily overlap so you

0:33:24.720,0:33:29.279
have to be careful with that okay now we

0:33:27.200,0:33:31.279
do we are going to use an avatar here so

0:33:29.279,0:33:34.399
this top left section over here is an

0:33:31.279,0:33:36.720
avatar right so this is actually derived

0:33:34.399,0:33:38.320
from material ui so what i'm going to do

0:33:36.720,0:33:40.240
is i'm going to import this over here so

0:33:38.320,0:33:43.039
i'm going to say import avatar from

0:33:40.240,0:33:44.720
material ui core like so and then what

0:33:43.039,0:33:46.880
i'm going to do is i'm going to go in

0:33:44.720,0:33:49.840
here and actually rather than directly

0:33:46.880,0:33:51.840
using the uh material ui avatar i'm

0:33:49.840,0:33:53.039
going to make it a start component i'm

0:33:51.840,0:33:55.600
kind of getting sick of that music so i

0:33:53.039,0:33:56.799
want my music back on epidemic boom

0:33:55.600,0:33:57.840
there we go we're going to have our

0:33:56.799,0:33:58.720
tunes back

0:33:57.840,0:34:00.480
there we go it's going to be a lot of

0:33:58.720,0:34:02.240
fun now this helps me get into a jam you

0:34:00.480,0:34:04.080
know that kind of you know a jam state

0:34:02.240,0:34:06.000
psycho coda what's up dude

0:34:04.080,0:34:07.039
welcome to the stream man smash the

0:34:06.000,0:34:08.560
thumbs up button if you're here and

0:34:07.039,0:34:10.000
you're enjoying it it's gonna be a lot

0:34:08.560,0:34:11.760
of fun today so buckle up and we're

0:34:10.000,0:34:13.359
gonna get into a nice flow at this point

0:34:11.760,0:34:15.040
okay so

0:34:13.359,0:34:17.919
header left let's go ahead and build out

0:34:15.040,0:34:21.280
this left section right so to have a

0:34:17.919,0:34:23.119
styled avatar right how do we do that so

0:34:21.280,0:34:25.119
over here i'm going to say const and

0:34:23.119,0:34:26.399
let's go ahead and say header avatar

0:34:25.119,0:34:28.079
okay and you can actually name these

0:34:26.399,0:34:29.839
whatever you want there is no real

0:34:28.079,0:34:32.480
standard at this point you can define it

0:34:29.839,0:34:35.280
but what if it's not a default sort of

0:34:32.480,0:34:37.359
like div or h1 or if it's actually like

0:34:35.280,0:34:39.040
a custom component right so what i'm

0:34:37.359,0:34:40.879
going to do here is i'm going to grab

0:34:39.040,0:34:43.520
the avatar and what i do is i do

0:34:40.879,0:34:46.000
parentheses avatar right that's how you

0:34:43.520,0:34:48.000
do it and then i have the double

0:34:46.000,0:34:49.440
quotes right and then you can make your

0:34:48.000,0:34:51.440
own styled component out of it which is

0:34:49.440,0:34:53.280
actually incredibly simple okay so

0:34:51.440,0:34:54.560
really really easy now random rabbit

0:34:53.280,0:34:56.399
studio says i actually like putting my

0:34:54.560,0:34:59.280
style components in its own file good

0:34:56.399,0:35:01.680
spot so you can right you very easily

0:34:59.280,0:35:03.839
can move your styled components out of

0:35:01.680,0:35:05.200
the code base and into their own files

0:35:03.839,0:35:07.440
in this tutorial i'm going to be

0:35:05.200,0:35:08.800
building inside of the same file and

0:35:07.440,0:35:10.720
we're going to be doing that way but i

0:35:08.800,0:35:12.640
will be introducing a folder structure

0:35:10.720,0:35:13.839
in this build so good thing you reminded

0:35:12.640,0:35:15.280
me dude i'm going to go ahead and say

0:35:13.839,0:35:17.280
components

0:35:15.280,0:35:18.560
right and inside the components folder

0:35:17.280,0:35:20.320
i'm going to grab my header and i'm

0:35:18.560,0:35:22.560
going to drag it inside now and all of

0:35:20.320,0:35:24.320
our components except the high level one

0:35:22.560,0:35:25.920
like app.js and i'm going to update the

0:35:24.320,0:35:28.880
imports yes

0:35:25.920,0:35:31.200
let's go ahead and go and save our input

0:35:28.880,0:35:33.920
import sorry so inside of app.js and now

0:35:31.200,0:35:35.760
it says components header save

0:35:33.920,0:35:36.960
make sure when you do that it all works

0:35:35.760,0:35:38.560
okay i'm gonna

0:35:36.960,0:35:40.160
refresh

0:35:38.560,0:35:42.160
and let's go ahead and see if we made

0:35:40.160,0:35:44.240
any mistake okay so it should be all

0:35:42.160,0:35:46.560
good now at this point and it's

0:35:44.240,0:35:48.720
compiling there we go okay so at this

0:35:46.560,0:35:50.800
point the header left right so header

0:35:48.720,0:35:52.160
avatar sorry inside of header left what

0:35:50.800,0:35:53.839
i'm going to do is i have a header

0:35:52.160,0:35:56.000
avatar i'm going to go ahead and pop

0:35:53.839,0:35:57.760
that in here so i'm going to say header

0:35:56.000,0:35:59.680
avatar

0:35:57.760,0:36:01.599
right header avatar and then i'm going

0:35:59.680,0:36:03.359
to go ahead and it's a self-closing

0:36:01.599,0:36:05.680
bracket okay so what we're going to do

0:36:03.359,0:36:07.839
at this point is

0:36:05.680,0:36:09.359
oh dude i really am getting irritated

0:36:12.880,0:36:16.560
going to block you okay so at this point

0:36:15.599,0:36:18.240
um

0:36:16.560,0:36:19.359
on click i'm going to have a long click

0:36:18.240,0:36:20.640
for this one this is going to be the

0:36:19.359,0:36:22.480
sign out but we're going to do that

0:36:20.640,0:36:24.160
afterwards i'm going to say to do

0:36:22.480,0:36:26.079
and that's a special extension that i'm

0:36:24.160,0:36:27.520
using there i'm going to say add on

0:36:26.079,0:36:28.880
click right so we're going to come back

0:36:27.520,0:36:30.560
to that one and then we're going to say

0:36:28.880,0:36:32.960
the alternative and the source now the

0:36:30.560,0:36:35.599
source here would actually be something

0:36:32.960,0:36:37.280
like the user's picture okay so this is

0:36:35.599,0:36:38.800
going to be the user's picture as we see

0:36:37.280,0:36:40.640
here but we're going to go ahead and

0:36:38.800,0:36:42.720
leave it blank for now okay so it's

0:36:40.640,0:36:43.920
gonna be a blank image for now and then

0:36:42.720,0:36:46.640
what i'm gonna do is i'm actually gonna

0:36:43.920,0:36:48.400
have the time icon so the time icon is

0:36:46.640,0:36:50.800
this one over here

0:36:48.400,0:36:53.760
okay so let's carry on

0:36:50.800,0:36:54.480
let's go ahead and jump over here

0:36:53.760,0:36:56.000
so

0:36:54.480,0:36:57.280
i'm gonna go ahead and save at this

0:36:56.000,0:36:59.119
point and let's see if we see it there

0:36:57.280,0:37:02.400
we go guys look our first little import

0:36:59.119,0:37:04.720
perfect okay um and pranav don't go

0:37:02.400,0:37:06.240
ahead and uh you know don't worry just

0:37:04.720,0:37:07.839
don't acknowledge people who spam that's

0:37:06.240,0:37:09.920
fine um so at this point we're going to

0:37:07.839,0:37:12.160
go ahead and leave the header avatar now

0:37:09.920,0:37:15.520
this the next thing i'm going to do is

0:37:12.160,0:37:17.520
pop in a icon okay so from material ui

0:37:15.520,0:37:19.200
so here i'm going to say import

0:37:17.520,0:37:21.359
access time icon i'm going to go

0:37:19.200,0:37:23.440
underneath here pop it in there like so

0:37:21.359,0:37:25.440
now we have our time icon as well we

0:37:23.440,0:37:27.280
should just jump in in a second there we

0:37:25.440,0:37:28.640
go guys okay so we have the little icon

0:37:27.280,0:37:30.880
and i'm going to make this eventually

0:37:28.640,0:37:32.240
look like this okay so stay tuned and

0:37:30.880,0:37:34.160
you'll find out how

0:37:32.240,0:37:35.839
so header left the first thing i want to

0:37:34.160,0:37:37.520
do is i want to give my a container some

0:37:35.839,0:37:38.880
styles so how do we do it when we're

0:37:37.520,0:37:40.800
using styled components it's pretty

0:37:38.880,0:37:42.240
simple actually we pretty much go here

0:37:40.800,0:37:44.560
and we just assume that this is regular

0:37:42.240,0:37:46.160
css inside of this we say display flex

0:37:44.560,0:37:47.599
and we do our regular sort of things

0:37:46.160,0:37:50.079
right so we say display flex and this

0:37:47.599,0:37:51.920
takes normal css rules so at this point

0:37:50.079,0:37:54.160
we don't see much changing okay so i'm

0:37:51.920,0:37:56.560
going to go ahead and firstly jump into

0:37:54.160,0:37:59.200
my header left styles okay so here i'm

0:37:56.560,0:38:01.359
going to say header left div and inside

0:37:59.200,0:38:03.599
of here what i'm going to do is i'm

0:38:01.359,0:38:06.160
going to go ahead and pop in the

0:38:03.599,0:38:08.000
following styles so we said display

0:38:06.160,0:38:09.920
flex in here and i want this one to take

0:38:08.000,0:38:12.400
up a third of the overall screen so i'm

0:38:09.920,0:38:14.880
going to say effects 0.3 okay then i

0:38:12.400,0:38:17.440
want this also to be a type display flex

0:38:14.880,0:38:18.720
i'm going to align the items centrally

0:38:17.440,0:38:20.480
so i'm going to go ahead and say align

0:38:18.720,0:38:23.119
item centrally and i'm going to give it

0:38:20.480,0:38:25.119
a margin left of 20 pixels because i

0:38:23.119,0:38:26.720
don't want it to touch rich programmer

0:38:25.119,0:38:29.359
what's up dude frank in the house

0:38:26.720,0:38:31.280
awesome slack 2.0 build let's go man

0:38:29.359,0:38:33.920
thank you so much frank for that clutch

0:38:31.280,0:38:35.040
donation appreciate you dude

0:38:33.920,0:38:38.079
all right

0:38:35.040,0:38:39.359
stormbreaker um redux template is

0:38:38.079,0:38:40.960
actually extremely easy and if you want

0:38:39.359,0:38:42.240
to find the easiest thing to use it's

0:38:40.960,0:38:44.400
recoil

0:38:42.240,0:38:47.040
we cover it inside the course but yeah

0:38:44.400,0:38:49.520
recoil is the easiest thing to use guys

0:38:47.040,0:38:51.599
right so the backticks are for the

0:38:49.520,0:38:54.079
syntax yes because we actually have some

0:38:51.599,0:38:56.640
kind of in uh props interpolation some

0:38:54.079,0:38:59.359
at some points okay now to target this

0:38:56.640,0:39:01.680
right target this icon so material ui

0:38:59.359,0:39:03.599
icons by default get the special class

0:39:01.680,0:39:06.000
and it's called material ui svg icon

0:39:03.599,0:39:09.119
dash root okay so at this point what i'm

0:39:06.000,0:39:11.040
going to do is if there is ever an icon

0:39:09.119,0:39:13.200
inside of here right inside the header

0:39:11.040,0:39:15.599
left so in this case access time icon

0:39:13.200,0:39:18.320
i'm going to target the icon by doing

0:39:15.599,0:39:21.599
this and this means inside header left

0:39:18.320,0:39:23.839
i'm going to target the material ui svg

0:39:21.599,0:39:25.440
root icon and i'm going to apply a style

0:39:23.839,0:39:28.000
so here what i'm going to do it's going

0:39:25.440,0:39:30.720
to say margin left auto and margin right

0:39:28.000,0:39:32.160
30 pixels save it and at this point you

0:39:30.720,0:39:33.440
can see we're starting to get this

0:39:32.160,0:39:34.400
spacing

0:39:33.440,0:39:35.599
correct

0:39:34.400,0:39:37.520
nice

0:39:35.599,0:39:39.119
okay and the reason why this is good is

0:39:37.520,0:39:41.200
because we're doing a flex roll so this

0:39:39.119,0:39:43.520
entire sort of top is flex and then

0:39:41.200,0:39:44.560
we're saying 0.3 flex so it's only

0:39:43.520,0:39:48.240
taking up

0:39:44.560,0:39:50.480
30 at this point right so this is 30

0:39:48.240,0:39:52.720
okay so i shouldn't save that but this

0:39:50.480,0:39:54.480
is actually 30 at this point right my

0:39:52.720,0:39:55.440
arrows are a bit dodgy

0:39:54.480,0:39:58.079
okay

0:39:55.440,0:39:59.839
so we have a 30 looking you know left

0:39:58.079,0:40:01.359
side over there which is pretty good so

0:39:59.839,0:40:03.680
let's go ahead and carry on so you guys

0:40:01.359,0:40:05.200
can already see it's pretty nice

0:40:03.680,0:40:07.359
actually to be fair right it's actually

0:40:05.200,0:40:09.280
pretty nice now what if i want to target

0:40:07.359,0:40:10.640
that header avatar right so i'm going to

0:40:09.280,0:40:11.920
go over to the header avatar and i want

0:40:10.640,0:40:14.000
to make it so that it actually looks

0:40:11.920,0:40:15.920
like it's a clickable element so firstly

0:40:14.000,0:40:17.920
i'm going to say okay grab it and say

0:40:15.920,0:40:19.440
cursor pointer

0:40:17.920,0:40:21.440
right and then what i'm going to say is

0:40:19.440,0:40:23.520
when i hover over it so you see how we

0:40:21.440,0:40:26.079
can apply the styles here it's actually

0:40:23.520,0:40:28.400
quite a nice syntax right when i hover

0:40:26.079,0:40:30.560
over i'm going to say the opacity

0:40:28.400,0:40:32.880
should change to 0.8

0:40:30.560,0:40:34.640
okay so when i do this

0:40:32.880,0:40:35.760
now check this out guys when i hover

0:40:34.640,0:40:37.280
over this

0:40:35.760,0:40:39.119
can you see that right that's quite a

0:40:37.280,0:40:40.240
nice little effect that we have going on

0:40:39.119,0:40:42.480
over there

0:40:40.240,0:40:44.240
right finn heart says does zero to full

0:40:42.480,0:40:46.480
stack hero also talk about how to get

0:40:44.240,0:40:48.800
clients yes dude we actually talk about

0:40:46.480,0:40:50.960
that a lot we see zero to full stack

0:40:48.800,0:40:53.359
hero is not just about building and

0:40:50.960,0:40:55.119
constantly coding it's about how you go

0:40:53.359,0:40:57.680
ahead and take those skills and actually

0:40:55.119,0:40:59.359
land jobs and freelancing clients a lot

0:40:57.680,0:41:01.440
of coaching calls we talk about people

0:40:59.359,0:41:02.640
who just had interviews my tips and

0:41:01.440,0:41:04.960
tricks on how they can approach

0:41:02.640,0:41:06.640
interviews and every week it's amazing

0:41:04.960,0:41:08.480
because we can go ahead and have a chat

0:41:06.640,0:41:10.560
with our with our own sort of you know

0:41:08.480,0:41:12.000
students inside the course and we can

0:41:10.560,0:41:13.839
see how their progression goes now

0:41:12.000,0:41:15.359
what's amazing about that guys and i

0:41:13.839,0:41:17.520
will carry on in just a sec is that

0:41:15.359,0:41:19.040
people have got jobs and then we have

0:41:17.520,0:41:21.280
feedback sessions in the coaching course

0:41:19.040,0:41:23.280
so really honestly you won't find that

0:41:21.280,0:41:25.440
anywhere else so it's it's for the

0:41:23.280,0:41:27.200
community that's why we've done it right

0:41:25.440,0:41:29.040
uh emerson says it's about the community

0:41:27.200,0:41:30.400
best ever exactly dude it's all about

0:41:29.040,0:41:32.640
the community that's exactly what we

0:41:30.400,0:41:34.079
strive for inside right

0:41:32.640,0:41:35.680
so for the header container i'm going to

0:41:34.079,0:41:36.960
go ahead and say position fixed and i'll

0:41:35.680,0:41:38.079
show you what i'm doing it's a little

0:41:36.960,0:41:39.680
bit of a hack what i'm doing here but

0:41:38.079,0:41:41.839
i'm saying position is fixed i want to

0:41:39.680,0:41:43.680
say a width of 100

0:41:41.839,0:41:45.280
and uh this will make a lot of sense

0:41:43.680,0:41:46.880
later and i'm going to say align the

0:41:45.280,0:41:49.040
item centrally and this will come into

0:41:46.880,0:41:50.160
play in just a sec afterwards line item

0:41:49.040,0:41:51.359
center

0:41:50.160,0:41:53.440
and then i'm going to go ahead and say

0:41:51.359,0:41:55.119
justify the content space between give

0:41:53.440,0:41:56.400
it a bit of padding so let's go ahead

0:41:55.119,0:41:57.760
and pop that in

0:41:56.400,0:41:59.359
save and you can see it should have a

0:41:57.760,0:42:00.560
little bit of padding at the top now and

0:41:59.359,0:42:02.960
then i'm going to say the background

0:42:00.560,0:42:06.400
color remember that css variable that we

0:42:02.960,0:42:08.880
defined earlier right it has to access

0:42:06.400,0:42:09.760
it all you need to do is type in

0:42:08.880,0:42:12.240
var

0:42:09.760,0:42:14.839
slack color right and remember where we

0:42:12.240,0:42:17.359
defined this was inside of

0:42:14.839,0:42:19.280
index.css over here remember slack color

0:42:17.359,0:42:22.079
we defined the variable here the css

0:42:19.280,0:42:23.280
variable and here we're using it okay

0:42:22.079,0:42:24.720
and we're making the color of the text

0:42:23.280,0:42:26.880
white there we go and that's because

0:42:24.720,0:42:28.480
these are actually sort of simple bits

0:42:26.880,0:42:31.200
of text pretty much

0:42:28.480,0:42:32.880
okay um i use something called screen

0:42:31.200,0:42:34.800
brush for the the sort of writing on the

0:42:32.880,0:42:37.760
screen what's up morocco's in the house

0:42:34.800,0:42:39.280
hey guys we're almost at 300 300 likes

0:42:37.760,0:42:40.960
let's keep going guys let's keep on

0:42:39.280,0:42:42.480
going all right so this is looking

0:42:40.960,0:42:44.400
pretty good right this is looking pretty

0:42:42.480,0:42:47.119
good at this point now let's go ahead

0:42:44.400,0:42:49.200
and fix the header search okay so the

0:42:47.119,0:42:52.240
header search section next priyanshu

0:42:49.200,0:42:53.359
what's up man good to see you here dude

0:42:52.240,0:42:55.040
hey

0:42:53.359,0:42:56.480
header search is the next bit okay so

0:42:55.040,0:42:59.520
over here i'm gonna say okay let's

0:42:56.480,0:43:01.200
create a header search start component

0:42:59.520,0:43:02.640
perfect right and inside the header

0:43:01.200,0:43:05.599
search we're going to have the search

0:43:02.640,0:43:07.119
icon so the search icon is actually from

0:43:05.599,0:43:08.720
material ui so i need to go ahead and

0:43:07.119,0:43:10.400
import that and you're probably

0:43:08.720,0:43:12.079
wondering but sunny you just wrote a

0:43:10.400,0:43:14.000
header search but you never defined it

0:43:12.079,0:43:15.680
right what is that about and you're

0:43:14.000,0:43:16.960
right i need to go ahead and define that

0:43:15.680,0:43:18.079
so i'll go down to the bottom and i'm

0:43:16.960,0:43:19.440
going to just add it to the top so that

0:43:18.079,0:43:21.200
way you guys can see

0:43:19.440,0:43:23.040
i'm going to say const header search and

0:43:21.200,0:43:24.480
this is going to be a style div and you

0:43:23.040,0:43:25.920
can see look it's not really not that

0:43:24.480,0:43:28.000
difficult to start getting the hang of

0:43:25.920,0:43:29.520
it okay so you can go style div and now

0:43:28.000,0:43:31.200
we can access the styles for it very

0:43:29.520,0:43:32.400
very simple stuff okay

0:43:31.200,0:43:34.240
um

0:43:32.400,0:43:35.520
so perfect stuff now we're gonna use

0:43:34.240,0:43:36.960
print up i'm not gonna use that today

0:43:35.520,0:43:38.800
but i might use the

0:43:36.960,0:43:40.960
app bar for material ui in a future

0:43:38.800,0:43:42.319
build that's a very good call dude um so

0:43:40.960,0:43:43.680
at this point i'm going to say header

0:43:42.319,0:43:45.839
search there we go

0:43:43.680,0:43:47.440
and i'm going to go ahead and check

0:43:45.839,0:43:49.920
we've already got the search icon over

0:43:47.440,0:43:51.359
there so i'm going to save okay

0:43:49.920,0:43:52.800
and then let's go ahead and you can see

0:43:51.359,0:43:54.640
at this point we've got some kind of

0:43:52.800,0:43:57.200
search icon being pushed over to the

0:43:54.640,0:43:58.480
right and that makes sense okay and i'll

0:43:57.200,0:44:00.000
tell you why in a sec so we've got the

0:43:58.480,0:44:01.440
search icon over here i'm going to have

0:44:00.000,0:44:03.760
an input field

0:44:01.440,0:44:05.599
now this input field is going to

0:44:03.760,0:44:07.200
hopefully make kicks in there we go it's

0:44:05.599,0:44:08.400
going to be of type text by default it's

0:44:07.200,0:44:10.079
already type text so we can get rid of

0:44:08.400,0:44:11.599
that we're going to say the placeholder

0:44:10.079,0:44:13.119
in this case is going to be to search

0:44:11.599,0:44:14.720
the proper firm all right because this

0:44:13.119,0:44:16.640
is going to be like the uh

0:44:14.720,0:44:18.160
sort of the slack for the papa farm

0:44:16.640,0:44:19.599
right and also just to mention guys if

0:44:18.160,0:44:21.440
you didn't already know we have an

0:44:19.599,0:44:23.200
incredible slack community inside zero

0:44:21.440,0:44:25.200
tool stack hero first link in the

0:44:23.200,0:44:26.880
description check it out sale runs out

0:44:25.200,0:44:29.040
in two days guys then i'm closing the

0:44:26.880,0:44:30.400
doors to the community so i want to miss

0:44:29.040,0:44:32.319
out on it honestly second link is

0:44:30.400,0:44:33.760
actually all of the code as well so you

0:44:32.319,0:44:36.319
know we're going crazy with sales right

0:44:33.760,0:44:37.920
now right so at the top of this screen

0:44:36.319,0:44:40.880
we have the search the puffer fan right

0:44:37.920,0:44:43.040
now i want that to look like this and be

0:44:40.880,0:44:44.560
in the correct position so how do i get

0:44:43.040,0:44:46.000
it to that point all right i'm going to

0:44:44.560,0:44:48.079
go over to my header search and what's

0:44:46.000,0:44:49.920
really cool is if i command click it

0:44:48.079,0:44:52.319
will actually sort of open up the header

0:44:49.920,0:44:54.640
search in the styled component location

0:44:52.319,0:44:56.000
so at this point we have that over here

0:44:54.640,0:44:57.680
right and then i'm going to go ahead and

0:44:56.000,0:45:00.560
apply a bunch of styles so

0:44:57.680,0:45:02.640
this bit took up 0.3 so 30 in the screen

0:45:00.560,0:45:05.359
i want the middle bit to take up 40 of

0:45:02.640,0:45:07.520
the screen okay so uh ever since

0:45:05.359,0:45:09.760
incredible no it's outstanding that's it

0:45:07.520,0:45:11.440

0:45:16.319,0:45:21.839
insane right we get more views and likes

0:45:19.599,0:45:23.440
than channels with hundreds of thousand

0:45:21.839,0:45:25.119
subscribers like

0:45:23.440,0:45:27.359
i think that's incredible i think we

0:45:25.119,0:45:29.119
should be proud of that as a family man

0:45:27.359,0:45:31.440
i think the whole papa fam should be

0:45:29.119,0:45:33.680
proud of that as a team this is not just

0:45:31.440,0:45:35.280
me this is built from you guys and this

0:45:33.680,0:45:37.200
is what we're about okay so like let's

0:45:35.280,0:45:38.319
go ahead and give ourselves like a huge

0:45:37.200,0:45:40.160
pat on the back for that because

0:45:38.319,0:45:42.800
honestly the way we're growing the way

0:45:40.160,0:45:43.760
what is happening it's so damn powerful

0:45:42.800,0:45:45.760
man

0:45:43.760,0:45:47.760
so i'm gonna go ahead and give this a

0:45:45.760,0:45:49.839
border color this is a slight gray color

0:45:47.760,0:45:51.760
and say text align center and you can

0:45:49.839,0:45:53.680
start to see guys look there's a slight

0:45:51.760,0:45:55.119
background being uh being chucked in

0:45:53.680,0:45:56.480
jamie davis that's a testament to the

0:45:55.119,0:45:58.400
value you provide us thank you so much

0:45:56.480,0:46:00.960
dude really really appreciate that

0:45:58.400,0:46:02.560
display flex padding not 50. i'm going

0:46:00.960,0:46:04.160
to go ahead and check that in here

0:46:02.560,0:46:05.839
save and you can see it starts to line

0:46:04.160,0:46:07.440
up okay it's starting to line up and

0:46:05.839,0:46:08.960
then we're going to say color of gray

0:46:07.440,0:46:10.560
and a border i'm going to go ahead and

0:46:08.960,0:46:12.000
chuck in the border and the color gray

0:46:10.560,0:46:14.319
over here now

0:46:12.000,0:46:16.480
at this point okay yeah it's looking

0:46:14.319,0:46:18.480
okay but i need to target that input

0:46:16.480,0:46:20.640
field right so the thing i love about

0:46:18.480,0:46:22.640
start components is we're already inside

0:46:20.640,0:46:25.119
of header search and inside of header

0:46:22.640,0:46:26.960
search is an input field which means

0:46:25.119,0:46:28.960
that we can go ahead and target the

0:46:26.960,0:46:31.200
input just like that which is a lot

0:46:28.960,0:46:32.640
simpler right fantana says oh we are

0:46:31.200,0:46:34.240
amazing for sure thanks to you sonny

0:46:32.640,0:46:36.160
appreciate it so much honestly really

0:46:34.240,0:46:37.119
really appreciate the cameras thank you

0:46:36.160,0:46:39.520
at this point i'm gonna say the

0:46:37.119,0:46:42.079
background color of this one is gonna be

0:46:39.520,0:46:43.359
transparent okay so background color

0:46:42.079,0:46:44.640
transparent i'm gonna go ahead and get

0:46:43.359,0:46:46.800
the energy up right now guys because

0:46:44.640,0:46:48.960
we're about to break 300 likes i think

0:46:46.800,0:46:49.760
we should step it up a bit let's go guys

0:46:48.960,0:46:52.000
all right

0:46:49.760,0:46:54.560
transparent there we go and at this

0:46:52.000,0:46:55.520
point i'm gonna go ahead and say border

0:46:54.560,0:46:57.839
none

0:46:55.520,0:47:01.119
and text align let's change the color up

0:46:57.839,0:47:03.760
in here as well right text align center

0:47:01.119,0:47:04.480
and i'm going to give it a minimum width

0:47:03.760,0:47:06.640
right

0:47:04.480,0:47:08.480
min width and i'm going to give this min

0:47:06.640,0:47:09.440
width to 30 view width

0:47:08.480,0:47:10.640
save

0:47:09.440,0:47:12.960
and at this point you can see look at

0:47:10.640,0:47:15.760
that it perfectly places itself in the

0:47:12.960,0:47:17.440
way that we expected okay now at this

0:47:15.760,0:47:19.359
point this looks pretty good but you see

0:47:17.440,0:47:21.359
we get this that kind of outline now the

0:47:19.359,0:47:24.160
quick fix to the outline is you simply

0:47:21.359,0:47:26.880
go ahead and do outline

0:47:24.160,0:47:28.559
zero or none pretty much i think zero

0:47:26.880,0:47:30.480
would work yeah there you go zero works

0:47:28.559,0:47:31.359
nicely and you see the color of the text

0:47:30.480,0:47:32.240
right we're gonna change that as well

0:47:31.359,0:47:34.079
i'm just gonna make the color of the

0:47:32.240,0:47:37.359
text to white

0:47:34.079,0:47:40.319
there we go save boom

0:47:37.359,0:47:42.160
all right sunny yeah exactly yeah

0:47:40.319,0:47:43.760
and there we go okay so at this point

0:47:42.160,0:47:46.000
what we're going to do is we have the

0:47:43.760,0:47:47.680
middle section complete now the reason

0:47:46.000,0:47:48.960
why it's not being pushed out like this

0:47:47.680,0:47:50.880
is because we don't have our right

0:47:48.960,0:47:52.880
section complete so i'm going to go

0:47:50.880,0:47:55.920
ahead and create the right section over

0:47:52.880,0:47:57.520
this point right so christopher asked he

0:51:17.359,0:51:21.760
about guys right the music is actually

0:51:19.760,0:51:23.040
part of my epidemic sounds playlist so

0:51:21.760,0:51:24.480
i'm going to go ahead and fix this one

0:51:23.040,0:51:26.079
the bible says looking fresh thank you

0:51:24.480,0:51:27.440
dude all right now let's go ahead and

0:51:26.079,0:51:29.599
finish off styling the header right

0:51:27.440,0:51:32.319
let's go ahead and do that so over here

0:51:29.599,0:51:33.920
header right perfect jump down here to

0:51:32.319,0:51:35.839
style head around we're going to say the

0:51:33.920,0:51:38.480
final bit should be a flex 0.3 because

0:51:35.839,0:51:39.680
think about it guys this was 0.3 which

0:51:38.480,0:51:42.400
is 30

0:51:39.680,0:51:44.240
this is 0.4 which is 40

0:51:42.400,0:51:45.839
and i want the final one to be 0.3 that

0:51:44.240,0:51:47.920
means it'll be perfectly sort of

0:51:45.839,0:51:49.119
positioned around right vocal the first

0:51:47.920,0:51:50.960
link in the description to go ahead and

0:51:49.119,0:51:52.559
check it all out we're going to say flex

0:51:50.960,0:51:54.000
0.3

0:51:52.559,0:51:56.960
there we go and i'm going to go ahead

0:51:54.000,0:51:59.040
and say display flex

0:51:56.960,0:52:00.480
there we go let's save and now you can

0:51:59.040,0:52:02.000
see look at that guys looks really

0:52:00.480,0:52:03.760
really clean right now okay and i'm

0:52:02.000,0:52:06.400
going to actually align the items flex

0:52:03.760,0:52:08.880
end so that way it sticks to the right

0:52:06.400,0:52:12.079
and if you ever get tempted to go ahead

0:52:08.880,0:52:14.880
and do something like float

0:52:12.079,0:52:15.599
i will personally come to you and slap

0:52:14.880,0:52:18.960
you

0:52:15.599,0:52:21.440
so don't use hello anymore guys it's old

0:52:18.960,0:52:22.960
it's it's gone don't do it all right

0:52:21.440,0:52:24.880
don't do that stuff

0:52:22.960,0:52:26.400
let's carry on alright so at this point

0:52:24.880,0:52:29.280
i'm going to go ahead and i'm going to

0:52:26.400,0:52:31.599
target the material you uh the material

0:52:29.280,0:52:33.599
ui icon okay so at this point i'm going

0:52:31.599,0:52:36.160
to say a material eye icon

0:52:33.599,0:52:38.240
like this and inside of here i'm going

0:52:36.160,0:52:40.559
to do margin left of auto margin right

0:52:38.240,0:52:41.440
20 pixels

0:52:40.559,0:52:43.599
right

0:52:41.440,0:52:45.200
there we go sanjay loved that one

0:52:43.599,0:52:46.880
so guys look at that that looks pretty

0:52:45.200,0:52:48.480
fresh right look at that boom i don't

0:52:46.880,0:52:51.119
even see a difference man look at that

0:52:48.480,0:52:53.520
no flicker except the little icon we

0:52:51.119,0:52:54.880
will fix that okay so flexbox is clean

0:52:53.520,0:52:56.400
like if you learn how to use flexbox

0:52:54.880,0:52:58.319
you're gonna kill it four likes away

0:52:56.400,0:53:00.720
from 300 likes let's smash that like

0:52:58.319,0:53:02.559
button and go forward guys let's keep on

0:53:00.720,0:53:03.760
going strong

0:53:02.559,0:53:04.800
right so at this point what i'm going to

0:53:03.760,0:53:06.800
do is let's go ahead and build the

0:53:04.800,0:53:08.319
sidebar perhaps right so i think we're

0:53:06.800,0:53:10.319
done with that yep we're done with that

0:53:08.319,0:53:12.640
and guys look this is just an example of

0:53:10.319,0:53:14.880
how powerful uh styled components is

0:53:12.640,0:53:16.640
like look how clean this is boom look at

0:53:14.880,0:53:17.760
that and the css is just down here and

0:53:16.640,0:53:19.599
you can move this into a separate

0:53:17.760,0:53:22.000
component if you want i would recommend

0:53:19.599,0:53:23.599
saying header.style.js

0:53:22.000,0:53:26.000
if you're going to do it okay that'll be

0:53:23.599,0:53:28.240
my recommendation we have 305 likes

0:53:26.000,0:53:30.400
thank you so much guys just keep on

0:53:28.240,0:53:32.480
going i love it it's bring me back to

0:53:30.400,0:53:34.240
life after that little tech issue let's

0:53:32.480,0:53:35.920
just kill it guys let's kill it all

0:53:34.240,0:53:37.599
right so

0:53:35.920,0:53:39.200
next thing i want to do is that sidebar

0:53:37.599,0:53:41.359
right so i'm going to jump back over to

0:53:39.200,0:53:42.960
app.js and you're going to see that we

0:53:41.359,0:53:45.440
actually have a very clean build today

0:53:42.960,0:53:47.280
okay so the next part right the entire

0:53:45.440,0:53:49.280
app what i'm going to assume is that

0:53:47.280,0:53:50.640
this bit over here so all of this is

0:53:49.280,0:53:52.800
actually going to be something like an

0:53:50.640,0:53:54.559
app body okay so this whole thing is

0:53:52.800,0:53:56.160
going to be like the app body right and

0:53:54.559,0:53:57.200
then the header is always going to show

0:53:56.160,0:53:58.880
right that's how we're going to kind of

0:53:57.200,0:54:00.319
build this out all right so at this

0:53:58.880,0:54:02.559
point what i want to do

0:54:00.319,0:54:04.720
is i'm going to have the header over

0:54:02.559,0:54:05.839
here and what i'm going to do is i'm

0:54:04.720,0:54:07.280
actually going to take the header

0:54:05.839,0:54:08.640
outside the switch

0:54:07.280,0:54:10.240
right so the header should always be

0:54:08.640,0:54:13.280
present here and then what i'm going to

0:54:10.240,0:54:15.760
do is i'm going to have app body

0:54:13.280,0:54:17.280
right and app body is going to have

0:54:15.760,0:54:19.920
everything inside and it's all going to

0:54:17.280,0:54:21.839
be determined by a switch okay now at

0:54:19.920,0:54:23.599
this point um what we're going to do is

0:54:21.839,0:54:25.280
i'm going to actually change this build

0:54:23.599,0:54:27.200
up a little bit so we might actually not

0:54:25.280,0:54:28.559
need to over complicate this but

0:54:27.200,0:54:29.920
eventually what we're going to have is a

0:54:28.559,0:54:31.040
chat

0:54:29.920,0:54:33.440
inside of here this is going to be a

0:54:31.040,0:54:36.000
chat component okay and we will make it

0:54:33.440,0:54:37.280
look super clean super nice now app body

0:54:36.000,0:54:38.720
what is that right so we need to go

0:54:37.280,0:54:42.079
ahead and define it so here i'm going to

0:54:38.720,0:54:43.920
say constant outbody equals a styled div

0:54:42.079,0:54:45.920
all right star div and then we go back

0:54:43.920,0:54:47.839
ticks

0:54:45.920,0:54:49.599
and then what is this

0:54:47.839,0:54:51.359
float that you talk about so if you

0:54:49.599,0:54:52.880
don't know what float is then just just

0:54:51.359,0:54:54.160
don't worry about it just pretend you

0:54:52.880,0:54:56.799
didn't hear anything

0:54:54.160,0:54:58.240
all right so says forget it exists

0:54:56.799,0:55:00.000
you shouldn't be using flow anymore it's

0:54:58.240,0:55:01.760
just it's an old way of handling things

0:55:00.000,0:55:03.680
okay so i'm going to go to the top

0:55:01.760,0:55:06.160
and i'm going to go ahead and do boom

0:55:03.680,0:55:09.119
import start from start component save

0:55:06.160,0:55:10.960
right and go ahead and refresh there we

0:55:09.119,0:55:12.480
go okay so we have the app body now what

0:55:10.960,0:55:14.319
i can do with this app body is i can

0:55:12.480,0:55:16.400
start defining styles of everything that

0:55:14.319,0:55:18.000
goes underneath there okay so inside of

0:55:16.400,0:55:19.839
there all i'm going to have is actually

0:55:18.000,0:55:21.119
before we go ahead and finish that bit

0:55:19.839,0:55:23.680
i'm going to have something called a

0:55:21.119,0:55:25.520
sidebar okay so over here i'm actually

0:55:23.680,0:55:27.200
going to have a sidebar component so

0:55:25.520,0:55:28.559
here i'll say oops i'm going to say

0:55:27.200,0:55:30.559
sidebar

0:55:28.559,0:55:32.799
and this will be responsible for this

0:55:30.559,0:55:34.160
sidebar that you see right here okay so

0:55:32.799,0:55:35.760
that's going to be the sidebar over

0:55:34.160,0:55:36.799
there now at this point what i'm going

0:55:35.760,0:55:39.440
to do

0:55:36.799,0:55:42.880
is um

0:55:39.440,0:55:44.400
right uh my name's sunny dude vibe uh

0:55:42.880,0:55:46.480
all right so let's carry on so i'm going

0:55:44.400,0:55:48.160
to go ahead and create a sidebar

0:55:46.480,0:55:49.760
component so i'm going to go ahead and

0:55:48.160,0:55:50.960
pop it in here so i'm going to create

0:55:49.760,0:55:51.920
i'm going to go into my components

0:55:50.960,0:55:54.799
folder

0:55:51.920,0:55:57.599
create sidebar.js

0:55:54.799,0:55:59.359
okay and i'm going to say rfce right for

0:55:57.599,0:56:02.799
a react functional component with an

0:55:59.359,0:56:04.880
export right now over inside the sidebar

0:56:02.799,0:56:05.760
let's go ahead and start coding this up

0:56:04.880,0:56:07.839
all right so the first thing i want to

0:56:05.760,0:56:09.440
do is create a sidebar container so this

0:56:07.839,0:56:11.520
one i'm going to change it to a sidebar

0:56:09.440,0:56:14.720
container now over here i'm going to say

0:56:11.520,0:56:15.680
consider by container equals a style div

0:56:14.720,0:56:17.119
all right so it's going to be our

0:56:15.680,0:56:19.280
surrounding container outside the

0:56:17.119,0:56:21.359
application go ahead and pop that down

0:56:19.280,0:56:24.240
like so now at this point i need to make

0:56:21.359,0:56:26.480
sure i ins import react start components

0:56:24.240,0:56:28.319
like this okay now guys we are going to

0:56:26.480,0:56:30.799
break 400 likes i'm telling you this

0:56:28.319,0:56:33.680
keep on pushing this energy i love it i

0:56:30.799,0:56:35.680
really can't believe it like how small

0:56:33.680,0:56:37.440
are sort of not even small guys 22 000

0:56:35.680,0:56:40.079
followers like subscribers right now but

0:56:37.440,0:56:42.880
we just continue to break like what is

0:56:40.079,0:56:44.640
expected from a channel with 22k subs

0:56:42.880,0:56:46.000
right let's keep on getting those likes

0:56:44.640,0:56:48.240
up and let's just kill it let's just

0:56:46.000,0:56:50.559
keep on going man let's just show the

0:56:48.240,0:56:51.599
whole world we're about this is crazy

0:56:50.559,0:56:53.839
all right

0:56:51.599,0:56:55.760
sidebar container over here right now

0:56:53.839,0:56:58.160
the sidebar has a few areas it has a

0:56:55.760,0:56:59.839
header and then it has a few extra bits

0:56:58.160,0:57:01.520
down here these are all called sidebar

0:56:59.839,0:57:03.119
option components and we're going to go

0:57:01.520,0:57:04.720
ahead and build them out okay so i'm

0:57:03.119,0:57:07.760
going to go ahead and show you how to do

0:57:04.720,0:57:09.280
that uh today now the sidebar header

0:57:07.760,0:57:14.079
right so let's go ahead and focus on

0:57:09.280,0:57:15.839
this header section over here okay so

0:57:14.079,0:57:17.599
um what we're going to do now is create

0:57:15.839,0:57:20.880
a sidebar header so i'm going to go

0:57:17.599,0:57:22.400
ahead and say okay sidebar header

0:57:20.880,0:57:24.079
and then i need to create that so i'm

0:57:22.400,0:57:27.839
going to say

0:57:24.079,0:57:27.839
sidebar header equals a star div

0:57:28.079,0:57:32.640
start div there we go and save right so

0:57:30.880,0:57:34.799
now we have our sidebar header over here

0:57:32.640,0:57:36.720
now inside what goes inside the sidebar

0:57:34.799,0:57:38.319
header so i actually have two sections

0:57:36.720,0:57:41.440
here i have a left section which i'm

0:57:38.319,0:57:42.799
going to refer to as sidebar info okay

0:57:41.440,0:57:45.200
and then i have i'm going to inside of

0:57:42.799,0:57:46.960
here i'm going to have a h2 and a h3

0:57:45.200,0:57:48.480
okay so over here what i'm going to do

0:57:46.960,0:57:51.359
is create another one called sidebar

0:57:48.480,0:57:52.160
info i'm going to say sidebar info like

man all right now i'm going to go ahead

0:59:20.960,0:59:25.839
and import the sidebar into our app.js

0:59:23.520,0:59:27.760
so over here i'm going to say app.js and

0:59:25.839,0:59:28.559
i'm going to go ahead and import this

0:59:27.760,0:59:31.359
right

0:59:28.559,0:59:33.119
boom import save right i'm gonna go

0:59:31.359,0:59:34.240
ahead fontana that's fire dude the hell

0:59:33.119,0:59:36.400
yeah man

0:59:34.240,0:59:38.079
right the fam grows man cesar you're

0:59:36.400,0:59:40.480
right that's it dude we just keep on

0:59:38.079,0:59:42.640
growing man all right so at this point

0:59:40.480,0:59:44.319
how do we go ahead and get this to look

0:59:42.640,0:59:46.480
the way we need it so we have the

0:59:44.319,0:59:48.480
sidebar over here okay

0:59:46.480,0:59:49.440
and what i want to just double check is

0:59:48.480,0:59:51.920
that

0:59:49.440,0:59:53.760
okay so firstly app body let's go ahead

0:59:51.920,0:59:54.640
and style this in a way that we need to

0:59:53.760,0:59:56.960
okay

0:59:54.640,0:59:59.119
so i'm gonna go ahead and first when we

0:59:56.960,1:00:01.119
have the sidebar body i'm gonna say this

0:59:59.119,1:00:02.799
is display flex and it has a height of

1:00:01.119,1:00:05.839
100 view height okay because i want to

1:00:02.799,1:00:07.520
use up the entire height save like so

1:00:05.839,1:00:08.799
i'm going to refresh and you can still

1:00:07.520,1:00:10.240
you can't see anything right now okay

1:00:08.799,1:00:12.079
i'm going to fix that in just a second i

1:00:10.240,1:00:14.640
think that might be because we haven't

1:00:12.079,1:00:16.400
actually saved this properly there we go

1:00:14.640,1:00:19.280
and you can see we will fix that in just

1:00:16.400,1:00:20.880
a sec let's go back to app.js over here

1:00:19.280,1:00:24.000
now what i'm going to do

1:00:20.880,1:00:26.079
is i'm going to make sure

1:00:24.000,1:00:28.640
right so we've got the sidebar here

1:00:26.079,1:00:30.160
perfect from component sidebar and let's

1:00:28.640,1:00:32.880
just double check right now we've got

1:00:30.160,1:00:34.559
the proper fam like so it's most likely

1:00:32.880,1:00:36.400
the color at this point so we'll go

1:00:34.559,1:00:38.160
ahead and fix that out so i'm going to

1:00:36.400,1:00:40.319
jump into my sidebar and when we have

1:00:38.160,1:00:42.240
the sidebar container i'm going to style

1:00:40.319,1:00:44.319
that one right now so cyborg container

1:00:42.240,1:00:45.839
style div and this one is going to be a

1:00:44.319,1:00:47.760
color white but the background color is

1:00:45.839,1:00:48.960
going to be the slack color okay so the

1:00:47.760,1:00:51.280
first thing we'll do is say background

1:00:48.960,1:00:54.319
color variable slack color and there you

1:00:51.280,1:00:56.000
go right that's how we do it um

1:00:54.319,1:00:58.400
looks fresh okay

1:00:56.000,1:01:01.440
so uh faizan i will be dropping react

1:00:58.400,1:01:03.680
native dude don't worry um

1:01:01.440,1:01:05.200
right an expo you should be using expo

1:01:03.680,1:01:06.799
dude if you are working on it until you

1:01:05.200,1:01:09.200
need anything else but

1:01:06.799,1:01:11.680
there you go color white there we go

1:01:09.200,1:01:13.680
and then what i'm going to say is a flex

1:01:11.680,1:01:16.079
of 0.3 because i want the sidebar to

1:01:13.680,1:01:18.160
only take up 30 so here we're going to

1:01:16.079,1:01:19.359
say flex of 0.3

1:01:18.160,1:01:21.760
and then you can see now it's taking up

1:01:19.359,1:01:24.400
0.3 okay and then what i'm going to say

1:01:21.760,1:01:26.240
is a border top of one pixel solid right

1:01:24.400,1:01:27.680
and i'm going to say a margin top of 60

1:01:26.240,1:01:30.160
pixels now there is a little trick i've

1:01:27.680,1:01:31.520
done here okay and what i've done here

1:01:30.160,1:01:32.960
is i've actually gone ahead and made

1:01:31.520,1:01:34.480
this fixed and there's a reason why

1:01:32.960,1:01:37.280
because later on i do this little cool

1:01:34.480,1:01:39.520
trick and now with a margin top of 60

1:01:37.280,1:01:40.960
pixels it shows okay and there's a

1:01:39.520,1:01:43.280
reason why because if you notice in the

1:01:40.960,1:01:45.280
final build if we have a long bit of

1:01:43.280,1:01:47.440
text right and we do this say hello

1:01:45.280,1:01:49.280
world let's just type in hello world

1:01:47.440,1:01:50.799
you see how it scrolls down it's a

1:01:49.280,1:01:53.040
little trick that we're doing to keep

1:01:50.799,1:01:54.960
the top it where it is okay so thank you

1:01:53.040,1:01:56.319
so much great energy appreciate it dude

1:01:54.960,1:01:57.599
so let's carry on

1:01:56.319,1:01:59.920
so at this point

1:01:57.599,1:02:01.599
let's keep going and we're going to have

1:01:59.920,1:02:03.119
a bunch of horizontal rows and we're

1:02:01.599,1:02:04.799
going to target that in a sec but we'll

1:02:03.119,1:02:07.520
leave it for now so at this point i

1:02:04.799,1:02:08.799
don't get this to look like this okay

1:02:07.520,1:02:10.240
because it they definitely don't look

1:02:08.799,1:02:12.160
like that right now

1:02:10.240,1:02:15.039
um what we need to do

1:02:12.160,1:02:17.359
is i'm gonna go ahead and firstly

1:02:15.039,1:02:20.000
next to the sidebar info i'm gonna get

1:02:17.359,1:02:22.480
that icon so it's called the create icon

1:02:20.000,1:02:24.400
and we need to import that from material

1:02:22.480,1:02:26.960
ui so i need to go to the top and say

1:02:24.400,1:02:29.039
import create icon from material ui

1:02:26.960,1:02:31.599
save now refresh and we should be able

1:02:29.039,1:02:34.559
to see the little pencil okay so let's

1:02:31.599,1:02:36.319
go ahead and make this um look in the

1:02:34.559,1:02:38.240
exact way we need to like this one over

1:02:36.319,1:02:40.079
here because that looks clean that looks

1:02:38.240,1:02:42.240
ugly okay we want to make it look a lot

1:02:40.079,1:02:43.920
better okay so

1:02:42.240,1:02:46.000
here what i'm going to do is i'm going

1:02:43.920,1:02:47.920
to go ahead and say let me turn my mic

1:02:46.000,1:02:49.599
gain down there we go i'm going to say

1:02:47.920,1:02:50.720
cyborg container and we've already

1:02:49.599,1:02:52.720
started this one out the next one we'll

1:02:50.720,1:02:54.799
do sidebar header okay so the for the

1:02:52.720,1:02:57.839
sidebar header i'm going to simply go

1:02:54.799,1:03:00.240
ahead and jump over to my my start

1:02:57.839,1:03:01.440
component where is it down here and i'm

1:03:00.240,1:03:03.359
going to give this one the following

1:03:01.440,1:03:04.799
we'll say display flex and it's gonna

1:03:03.359,1:03:06.720
have a border bottom so let me go ahead

1:03:04.799,1:03:09.200
and just grab this i'm gonna say display

1:03:06.720,1:03:11.599
flex or the bottom padding bottom and a

1:03:09.200,1:03:13.920
padding around it okay

1:03:11.599,1:03:16.319
there we go let's just chuck that in

1:03:13.920,1:03:17.839
and this actually eradicates this one so

1:03:16.319,1:03:19.200
we can go ahead and get rid of that and

1:03:17.839,1:03:21.039
you can see now it's somewhat got a

1:03:19.200,1:03:23.440
similar structure but the text isn't the

1:03:21.039,1:03:24.240
same okay now we have an icon here this

1:03:23.440,1:03:26.319
one

1:03:24.240,1:03:27.760
right now display flex made it into a

1:03:26.319,1:03:30.400
row which is why this is now on the

1:03:27.760,1:03:31.920
right of this okay if you guys know

1:03:30.400,1:03:33.760
peter mckinnon you'll know what this

1:03:31.920,1:03:35.520
song is about right this is where it's

1:03:33.760,1:03:36.720
about it's where it's from

1:03:35.520,1:03:38.880
um

1:03:36.720,1:03:40.240
so i'm going to do material ui svg so

1:03:38.880,1:03:42.559
i'm going to target the inner material

1:03:40.240,1:03:44.720
ui icon and then in here i'm going to

1:03:42.559,1:03:47.520
give this icon a padding of 8 pixels a

1:03:44.720,1:03:49.039
color a font size a border radius so it

1:03:47.520,1:03:51.200
has a nice little circle behind it and a

1:03:49.039,1:03:53.039
background color of white and we should

1:03:51.200,1:03:54.799
with these rules get it to look like

1:03:53.039,1:03:56.480
this let's go ahead and give that a try

1:03:54.799,1:03:59.280
boom save

1:03:56.480,1:04:00.960
kapow there we go looks good right i

1:03:59.280,1:04:02.880
like that i think that looks really nice

1:04:00.960,1:04:05.119
the next thing i want to do is we have

1:04:02.880,1:04:07.680
sidebar info now sidebar info is this

1:04:05.119,1:04:10.880
bit i want this to essentially look like

1:04:07.680,1:04:13.039
this okay so let's go ahead and make it

1:04:10.880,1:04:15.200
that way okay so we will have redux

1:04:13.039,1:04:16.799

1:05:20.799,1:05:25.280
size 13 font size 13.

1:05:23.039,1:05:27.359
um and i would say font weight to 400 a

1:05:25.280,1:05:29.280
line item center right

1:05:27.359,1:05:31.039
so let's go ahead and do this boom

1:05:29.280,1:05:33.200
there we go save

1:05:31.039,1:05:34.240
and then oh my one's in the house what's

1:05:33.200,1:05:35.680
up babe

1:05:34.240,1:05:37.520
my gorgeous girlfriend's in the house

1:05:35.680,1:05:39.280
and yeah i actually had a bad issue but

1:05:37.520,1:05:40.720
we're back now okay so i'm going to

1:05:39.280,1:05:42.880
target this is the thing that i like by

1:05:40.720,1:05:45.359
the way so i have a h3 tag and if you

1:05:42.880,1:05:48.799
see over here i have a h3 and inside of

1:05:45.359,1:05:51.200
it i have that material ui icon okay so

1:05:48.799,1:05:53.119
usually you have to do some janky weird

1:05:51.200,1:05:55.280
stuff in css right but this is pretty

1:05:53.119,1:05:57.039
clean taran please don't spam dude all

1:05:55.280,1:05:58.799
right so here what i'm going to say is

1:05:57.039,1:06:00.240
target the h3

1:05:58.799,1:06:02.640
see later gwen

1:06:00.240,1:06:06.480
and i'm going to target the material ui

1:06:02.640,1:06:08.480
svg root icon go ahead and grab that

1:06:06.480,1:06:10.079
and then here i'm going to go ahead and

1:06:08.480,1:06:11.760
have the font size

1:06:10.079,1:06:13.680
uh i'm going to go ahead and font size

1:06:11.760,1:06:16.160
14 margin top one pixel margin right two

1:06:13.680,1:06:17.839
pixels and a color of green and you'll

1:06:16.160,1:06:19.839
notice that this will suddenly change

1:06:17.839,1:06:21.280
into a beautiful looking icon and it'll

1:06:19.839,1:06:23.760
have that sort of you know that signed

1:06:21.280,1:06:25.359
in look and feel to it okay so that's

1:06:23.760,1:06:27.440
exactly what i wanted right there right

1:06:25.359,1:06:29.839
now if you notice look at that looks

1:06:27.440,1:06:31.119
pretty damn good to me okay

1:06:29.839,1:06:32.640
now the reason why this is a little bit

1:06:31.119,1:06:34.480
different is because we have this chat

1:06:32.640,1:06:35.520
component on the right but we will get

1:06:34.480,1:06:38.319
there okay we're going to get to that

1:06:35.520,1:06:39.359
point guys let's hit 400 likes if you're

1:06:38.319,1:06:41.359

1:06:39.359,1:06:42.559
smashed the thumbs up button smash it

1:06:41.359,1:06:44.799
because it's going to help this video

1:06:42.559,1:06:48.319
get to as many people as possible with

1:06:44.799,1:06:48.319
that said quick wall break

1:06:50.240,1:06:55.280
what's up rishi he's watching on um

1:06:53.200,1:06:57.200
richie lola

1:06:55.280,1:07:00.400
laura sorry dude i always get it wrong

1:06:57.200,1:07:02.960
uh he's watching on twitch let's go

1:07:00.400,1:07:04.079
okay so at this point i'm gonna go ahead

1:07:02.960,1:07:06.079
and have

1:07:04.079,1:07:08.400
over here we have the create icon so the

1:07:06.079,1:07:10.000
sidebar header is essentially complete

1:07:08.400,1:07:12.079
okay so we have the header which is

1:07:10.000,1:07:13.920
essentially complete now down here we're

1:07:12.079,1:07:15.680
gonna have a reusable component and

1:07:13.920,1:07:16.559
we're gonna call this one this sidebar

1:07:15.680,1:07:18.720
option

1:07:16.559,1:07:20.480
okay it's a sidebar option so i already

1:07:18.720,1:07:21.920
have my coffee thank you so much dude um

1:07:20.480,1:07:23.039
so cyber options so i'm gonna go ahead

1:07:21.920,1:07:24.880
and create that right now so i'm gonna

1:07:23.039,1:07:26.319
open up my code go into my components

1:07:24.880,1:07:28.319
folder and you can see your sites look

1:07:26.319,1:07:31.280
pretty clean okay let's say sidebar

1:07:28.319,1:07:31.280
option.js

1:07:31.440,1:07:37.200
i'm going to hide that rfce

1:07:34.720,1:07:38.799
boom right let's go ahead whoa nigeria

1:07:37.200,1:07:40.640
in the house what's up man

1:07:38.799,1:07:42.079
and then here again you can see like you

1:07:40.640,1:07:43.680
start getting into a flow of it right

1:07:42.079,1:07:45.039
i'm going to say cons sidebar option

1:07:43.680,1:07:47.359
container

1:07:45.039,1:07:48.880
and we'll say equals star div right star

1:07:47.359,1:07:52.160
div and you just want to go ahead and

1:07:48.880,1:07:53.680
get you know like that muscle memory up

1:07:52.160,1:07:55.520
i always say like it's not you don't

1:07:53.680,1:07:57.280
have to be the best coder you just need

1:07:55.520,1:07:59.520
to get that pattern recognition and you

1:07:57.280,1:08:01.039
slowly figure things out guys

1:07:59.520,1:08:02.559
i don't remember everything off the top

1:08:01.039,1:08:04.640
of my head i don't think i don't i

1:08:02.559,1:08:06.480
really don't expect any developer to but

1:08:04.640,1:08:08.400
you want to go ahead and make sure you

1:08:06.480,1:08:10.720
just take the time to ingrain that

1:08:08.400,1:08:12.000
muscle memory okay like because it does

1:08:10.720,1:08:13.920
make a difference okay it's very

1:08:12.000,1:08:15.839
important um

1:08:13.920,1:08:17.920
practice will lead to that okay so at

1:08:15.839,1:08:20.480
this point we have our sidebar over here

1:08:17.920,1:08:22.080
now what we're gonna do is have a bunch

1:08:20.480,1:08:24.719
of these sidebars now these are gonna

1:08:22.080,1:08:27.279
have two props okay i want to pass in a

1:08:24.719,1:08:29.600
prop which is the icon itself and i want

1:08:27.279,1:08:31.199
to pass in the title which is going to

1:08:29.600,1:08:32.640
be like this the title mentions and

1:08:31.199,1:08:35.120
reactions and so forth and each

1:08:32.640,1:08:36.880
individual icon now what i've actually

1:08:35.120,1:08:38.960
done here is i'll show you how i want

1:08:36.880,1:08:41.040
this to look so let's assume i had all

1:08:38.960,1:08:42.799
of these right in so inside my code so

1:08:41.040,1:08:44.960
just to save some time i've actually

1:08:42.799,1:08:46.880
gone ahead and imported those already

1:08:44.960,1:08:48.799
now in react you can have each component

1:08:46.880,1:08:51.120
can take props right now props are

1:08:48.799,1:08:52.799
properties they allow

1:08:51.120,1:08:54.640
dax says it's gonna be recorded yes dude

1:08:52.799,1:08:56.799
it's gonna be recorded um

1:08:54.640,1:08:58.319
and it will allow a component to render

1:08:56.799,1:09:00.319
with slight differences based on the

1:08:58.319,1:09:02.480
properties that you pass in okay so at

1:09:00.319,1:09:04.319
this point let's go ahead and paste

1:09:02.480,1:09:05.600
right so i've got this right here and

1:09:04.319,1:09:07.199
you guys can see that we've just got a

1:09:05.600,1:09:08.960
bunch of these and each one is getting a

1:09:07.199,1:09:10.719
different icon and it's getting a

1:09:08.960,1:09:12.960
different title now i will show you how

1:09:10.719,1:09:15.279
to consume that in just a sec but let's

1:09:12.960,1:09:17.520
go ahead and first import all of those

1:09:15.279,1:09:21.839
icons as necessary okay so it's going to

1:09:17.520,1:09:23.520
be from the to all the way to expand

1:09:21.839,1:09:25.839
all right so i'm gonna go ahead and grab

1:09:23.520,1:09:27.120
a bunch of icons and import them okay so

1:09:25.839,1:09:29.279
you can pause the video there watch it

1:09:27.120,1:09:32.000
if you need to get those icons now at

1:09:29.279,1:09:33.520
this point what we should see is cyborg

1:09:32.000,1:09:35.199
option is not defined okay so obviously

1:09:33.520,1:09:37.520
it makes sense all right we need to go

1:09:35.199,1:09:39.520
to cyber option hit save and then i need

1:09:37.520,1:09:41.279
to go to sidebar and go ahead and do my

1:09:39.520,1:09:42.920
little go to the end of the component

1:09:41.279,1:09:45.600
control spacebar

1:09:42.920,1:09:47.199
and there we go and see the second one

1:09:45.600,1:09:49.279
is a source component sidebar option

1:09:47.199,1:09:51.920
that actually does an auto import trick

1:09:49.279,1:09:53.440
okay iman says fire bro thank you so

1:09:51.920,1:09:54.480
much dude appreciate you watching let's

1:09:53.440,1:09:56.320
go ahead and do that now you can see

1:09:54.480,1:09:58.000
look it loads right now nothing's on the

1:09:56.320,1:09:59.440
screen so we're gonna go ahead and make

1:09:58.000,1:10:01.920
sure something actually shows up on the

1:09:59.440,1:10:03.679
screen okay guys just hit 400 likes come

1:10:01.920,1:10:05.760
on we can do it i know it we can keep

1:10:03.679,1:10:06.640
pushing this stuff right so

1:10:05.760,1:10:08.640
what we're going to do is we have the

1:10:06.640,1:10:11.199
icon then we have the title thread so in

1:10:08.640,1:10:12.480
this case what i want to do here is i

1:10:11.199,1:10:14.080
want to actually consume this as

1:10:12.480,1:10:16.400
something called props like i mentioned

1:10:14.080,1:10:19.199
before so perhaps comes through as a

1:10:16.400,1:10:21.199
simple function argument okay so at this

1:10:19.199,1:10:23.600
point what i want to do

1:10:21.199,1:10:25.440
is i'm going to go ahead and do i'm

1:10:23.600,1:10:28.239
going to destructure which means i'm

1:10:25.440,1:10:30.400
essentially going to go ahead and tear

1:10:28.239,1:10:33.280
apart right i'm gonna basically go ahead

1:10:30.400,1:10:34.640
and tear apart the object okay so i'm

1:10:33.280,1:10:36.320
gonna go ahead and pull apart the object

1:10:34.640,1:10:37.760
at this point i'm gonna pull the icon

1:10:36.320,1:10:40.719
out and the title this is called

1:10:37.760,1:10:42.840
destructuring okay uh robert there is

1:10:40.719,1:10:45.360
actually all the code inside the github

1:10:42.840,1:10:46.880
repo um but we need to kind of move a

1:10:45.360,1:10:49.040
little faster than this one so uh let's

1:10:46.880,1:10:51.280
carry on dude so this point um rather

1:10:49.040,1:10:52.800
than sidebar container a sidebar option

1:10:51.280,1:10:54.880
actually that's good we can keep it as

1:10:52.800,1:10:56.080
that okay so i'm gonna go ahead and jump

1:10:54.880,1:10:58.400
in

1:10:56.080,1:11:01.040
right so now at this point what i'm also

1:10:58.400,1:11:03.120
going to do is there we go that's fine

1:11:01.040,1:11:05.040
actually we've got icon and title

1:11:03.120,1:11:07.520
so you can see we're actually passing in

1:11:05.040,1:11:09.280
a whole icon here right so and that's

1:11:07.520,1:11:10.480
the reason why this is a capital i not a

1:11:09.280,1:11:12.560
lowercase i because we're going to be

1:11:10.480,1:11:14.880
rendering it on the screen in just a sec

1:11:12.560,1:11:16.640
now inside of here right what i'm going

1:11:14.880,1:11:18.400
to do is i'm going to have a few things

1:11:16.640,1:11:20.560
in there so i'm going to say okay if you

1:11:18.400,1:11:22.159
passed in an icon right so we're going

1:11:20.560,1:11:24.239
to protect ourselves

1:11:22.159,1:11:26.640
then i'm going to render the icon out

1:11:24.239,1:11:28.640
okay it's a self-closing component and

1:11:26.640,1:11:30.159
all of these icons in material ui take a

1:11:28.640,1:11:32.480
font size and then we can give that a

1:11:30.159,1:11:33.199
font size of small okay

1:11:32.480,1:11:34.400
now

1:11:33.199,1:11:35.920
here i'm actually going to give it an

1:11:34.400,1:11:37.679
inline style because it's a bit hard to

1:11:35.920,1:11:40.080
do a uh

1:11:37.679,1:11:41.199
a styled component in that use case so

1:11:40.080,1:11:42.960
i'm going to say just give it a padding

1:11:41.199,1:11:44.320
of 10 for each of these right so there

1:11:42.960,1:11:46.640
we go now at this point you can see all

1:11:44.320,1:11:47.760
the icons have just popped in

1:11:46.640,1:11:49.600
so it's looking pretty good at this

1:11:47.760,1:11:52.000
point right so and the reason why i put

1:11:49.600,1:11:54.480
icon and is because you might actually

1:11:52.000,1:11:56.400
render the component now without passing

1:11:54.480,1:11:58.320
in an icon okay so the second thing i'm

1:11:56.400,1:11:59.840
gonna say is okay if you pass the icon

1:11:58.320,1:12:01.520
then what i'm gonna say is i'm gonna go

1:11:59.840,1:12:03.840
ahead and render

1:12:01.520,1:12:05.920
a h3 which has the tie tool okay so here

1:12:03.840,1:12:08.640
i'm gonna say okay jsx with the squiggly

1:12:05.920,1:12:10.400
brackets i'm gonna say title like this

1:12:08.640,1:12:12.239
and here is we're using a ternary

1:12:10.400,1:12:14.400
operator so this basically means if if

1:12:12.239,1:12:16.239
icon is truthy so if it's true or if it

1:12:14.400,1:12:18.320
has a value inside of it render this out

1:12:16.239,1:12:21.199
otherwise render out whatever in this

1:12:18.320,1:12:23.280
side of in this parentheses so at this

1:12:21.199,1:12:25.520
point what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna go

1:12:23.280,1:12:28.080
ahead and create a sidebar option

1:12:25.520,1:12:29.920
channel um div okay so this is actually

1:12:28.080,1:12:31.840
gonna be a start component

1:12:29.920,1:12:33.120
and i'm gonna create this over here so

1:12:31.840,1:12:34.640
i'm gonna copy that

1:12:33.120,1:12:37.679
i'm gonna go ahead and

1:12:34.640,1:12:39.360
grab this line

1:12:37.679,1:12:40.960
and then i'm also going to go ahead and

1:12:39.360,1:12:42.560
boom

1:12:40.960,1:12:45.360
there we go cyber option channel there

1:12:42.560,1:12:47.280
we go now at this point we have this div

1:12:45.360,1:12:49.280
star div there and i'm just going to

1:12:47.280,1:12:52.480
span a hashtag here right i'm going to

1:12:49.280,1:12:54.800
span a hashtag and i'm going to have the

1:12:52.480,1:12:56.320
title over here and there's a reason why

1:12:54.800,1:12:58.480
we're doing this now it'll make a lot of

1:12:56.320,1:13:00.480
sense in just a sec okay so i'm going to

1:12:58.480,1:13:02.159
go ahead and hit save code with yog says

1:13:00.480,1:13:04.400

for that yeah that's how it is abhishek

1:13:20.239,1:13:22.480
what's up dude

1:13:21.600,1:13:23.920
right

1:13:22.480,1:13:25.360
so at this point you can see look this

1:13:23.920,1:13:26.480
is how it's looking right i don't want

1:13:25.360,1:13:28.880
it to look like this i want to look a

1:13:26.480,1:13:31.760
little bit cleaner than this so

1:13:28.880,1:13:33.280
how do i style it to look in that way so

1:13:31.760,1:13:34.640
i'm going to go to the sidebar option

1:13:33.280,1:13:36.640
container and the first thing we'll say

1:13:34.640,1:13:37.679
is display flex now i do want to see my

1:13:36.640,1:13:40.320
code so i'm going to go ahead and make

1:13:37.679,1:13:42.400
it like this i'm going to say display

1:13:40.320,1:13:44.719
flex okay save and you can see

1:13:42.400,1:13:46.560
everything goes into a row okay hey

1:13:44.719,1:13:49.199
maven's here she goes yes guys hold on

1:13:46.560,1:13:51.120
sunny sunny let's go for food after

1:13:49.199,1:13:52.560
yeah honestly i got

1:13:51.120,1:13:54.400
the headache this gave me that one

1:13:52.560,1:13:56.239
called me up and i gave her i was a bit

1:13:54.400,1:13:58.080
grumpy because uh you know the the

1:13:56.239,1:14:00.239
stream cut but thank you babe for

1:13:58.080,1:14:02.800
sticking in right so at this point we'll

1:14:00.239,1:14:04.960
say display flex font size

1:14:02.800,1:14:07.040
of 12 pixels and then i'm going to say

1:14:04.960,1:14:09.280
align items center

1:14:07.040,1:14:11.040
okay line item center padding left of

1:14:09.280,1:14:14.320
two pixels

1:14:11.040,1:14:16.560
a padding left of two pixels

1:14:14.320,1:14:17.920
all right so two pixels like this and

1:14:16.560,1:14:19.360
then i'm going to say a cursor pointer

1:14:17.920,1:14:21.840
because i want all of these to be like

1:14:19.360,1:14:24.960
somewhat course of as you hover over it

1:14:21.840,1:14:27.440
right you can say sorry i'm sorry okay

1:14:24.960,1:14:29.280
there we go i'm sorry for being grumpy

1:14:27.440,1:14:30.320
papa react is kind of grumpy at times

1:14:29.280,1:14:31.600
guys

1:14:30.320,1:14:32.800
so there you go

1:14:31.600,1:14:34.640
all right i'm gonna say okay when i

1:14:32.800,1:14:37.440
hover over it i want to change the

1:14:34.640,1:14:38.480
opacity right so in order to do that

1:14:37.440,1:14:40.239
what i do

1:14:38.480,1:14:41.280
is

1:14:40.239,1:14:43.120
i

1:14:41.280,1:14:45.280
it i'm now she's taking the neck alright

1:14:43.120,1:14:46.480
so opacity 0.9 i'm gonna change the

1:14:45.280,1:14:48.080
background color when i hover over it

1:14:46.480,1:14:50.159
okay so

1:14:48.080,1:14:51.520
let's go ahead and refresh

1:14:50.159,1:14:55.679
and then you see that guys look at that

1:14:51.520,1:14:57.280
fresh okay look at that looks good

1:14:55.679,1:14:59.040
looks pretty clean now you can see over

1:14:57.280,1:15:01.280
here look we're almost there and it's

1:14:59.040,1:15:02.480
looking pretty good at this point okay

1:15:01.280,1:15:05.040
so what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna target

1:15:02.480,1:15:07.520
the h3 right now the h3 sits over here

1:15:05.040,1:15:09.040
okay so in order to grab it again start

1:15:07.520,1:15:11.120
components makes this so easy we can say

1:15:09.040,1:15:12.480
h3 grab it i'm going to say a font

1:15:11.120,1:15:14.000
weight because i want to reduce the

1:15:12.480,1:15:16.320
boldness of that text i'm going to say

1:15:14.000,1:15:18.080
it should be a 500 sort of weight okay

1:15:16.320,1:15:19.520
so 500 is somewhat of an average rate

1:15:18.080,1:15:21.600
you can see it drops the font size a

1:15:19.520,1:15:24.159
little bit more okay so after we've done

1:15:21.600,1:15:25.760
the h3 i'm going to jump into the h3 and

1:15:24.159,1:15:28.400
i'm going to jump into a span tag and as

1:15:25.760,1:15:30.320
you can remember over here we had a span

1:15:28.400,1:15:32.400
for the hashtag there's a reason why i

1:15:30.320,1:15:35.840
spam the hashtag it's because i only

1:15:32.400,1:15:38.000
want to style the that one hashtag right

1:15:35.840,1:15:40.640
i just want to go ahead and uh yeah all

1:15:38.000,1:15:42.080
right so uh now i see uh augustine says

1:15:40.640,1:15:43.679
wow the engine this platform is mad

1:15:42.080,1:15:45.199
exactly dude that's what we're about

1:15:43.679,1:15:48.000
honestly it's just you know we just have

1:15:45.199,1:15:49.120
fun here man padding of 15 pixels okay

1:15:48.000,1:15:51.280
that's it

1:15:49.120,1:15:53.040
and uh and we code right we code

1:15:51.280,1:15:55.440
properly that's how we do it right so

1:15:53.040,1:15:57.120
look at that that looks clean man i like

1:15:55.440,1:15:58.560
that that looks pretty good so at this

1:15:57.120,1:16:01.600
point what we're going to do is i'm

1:15:58.560,1:16:03.440
going to go back up to my code and now

1:16:01.600,1:16:06.480
we have this reusable component okay so

1:16:03.440,1:16:08.400
it looks pretty good at this point um

1:16:06.480,1:16:09.920
what was very useful about this is that

1:16:08.400,1:16:12.320
we actually made it so that if we don't

1:16:09.920,1:16:13.760
pass an icon in we can just use the type

1:16:12.320,1:16:15.920
we can just render our title now why is

1:16:13.760,1:16:17.440
that handy because if you wanted to have

1:16:15.920,1:16:19.840
it like you can pretty much have it as

1:16:17.440,1:16:21.920
just like channels without an icon so

1:16:19.840,1:16:23.040
it's a nice way of doing it okay so what

1:16:21.920,1:16:25.520
we can do is i'm gonna go back to

1:16:23.040,1:16:26.800
sidebar and over here so i'm gonna go

1:16:25.520,1:16:28.320
ahead and make that a bit smaller so you

1:16:26.800,1:16:30.080
guys can see it there we go

1:16:28.320,1:16:31.840
over here what i'm gonna say is where we

1:16:30.080,1:16:34.000
have sidebar option

1:16:31.840,1:16:34.800
michael what's up dude michael actually

1:16:34.000,1:16:37.679
won

1:16:34.800,1:16:39.520
uh a prize inside of um

1:16:37.679,1:16:41.199
i think it was a second place michael so

1:16:39.520,1:16:43.440
congrats dude inside the netflix

1:16:41.199,1:16:45.120
challenge absolutely smashed it did so

1:16:43.440,1:16:47.120
here i'm going to drop horizontal lines

1:16:45.120,1:16:48.480
okay so you see over in this build we

1:16:47.120,1:16:49.840
have the horizontal lines coming in

1:16:48.480,1:16:51.600
clutch over here and here so i'm going

1:16:49.840,1:16:52.719
to go ahead and do the same thing over

1:16:51.600,1:16:54.400
in our build okay so i'm going to say

1:16:52.719,1:16:56.239
horizontal line

1:16:54.400,1:16:58.080
and then you can see over here it just

1:16:56.239,1:16:59.440
looks pretty ugly at that point but

1:16:58.080,1:17:00.719
we'll style it right we'll make it

1:16:59.440,1:17:02.400
better

1:17:00.719,1:17:03.920
and then i'm gonna have another cyber

1:17:02.400,1:17:04.880
option okay so i don't know why that

1:17:03.920,1:17:07.280
jumped over there i'm gonna have another

1:17:04.880,1:17:08.480
cyber option with the expand more icon

1:17:07.280,1:17:10.239
and the title is gonna be channels and

1:17:08.480,1:17:13.679
this is what the beauty right this is

1:17:10.239,1:17:15.440
the real beauty of the um

1:17:13.679,1:17:17.600
this is the beauty of style component of

1:17:15.440,1:17:18.800
reusable components okay and style

1:17:17.600,1:17:20.560
components i guess because we're using

1:17:18.800,1:17:22.400
both of them but it's really really

1:17:20.560,1:17:25.280
clean because reasonable components like

1:17:22.400,1:17:26.719
if you do them well you can code so fast

1:17:25.280,1:17:28.480
right because you don't have to repeat

1:17:26.719,1:17:29.920
yourself it also makes it a lot easier

1:17:28.480,1:17:31.360
to maintain your code base okay so this

1:17:29.920,1:17:33.040
is really good guys come on almost at

1:17:31.360,1:17:34.560
400 likes let's go

1:17:33.040,1:17:36.640
all right so i'm going to drop another

1:17:34.560,1:17:38.400
horizontal row over here so boom we

1:17:36.640,1:17:39.600
should have another line and then what

1:17:38.400,1:17:41.840
i'm going to do is i'm going to have an

1:17:39.600,1:17:44.239
add icon channel right so here i'm going

1:17:41.840,1:17:46.960
to have another ad icon and this has

1:17:44.239,1:17:48.320
another prop called add channel option

1:17:46.960,1:17:51.040
okay and i'll show you what we do with

1:17:48.320,1:17:52.400
that one in just a sec but if i go ahead

1:17:51.040,1:17:54.000
and save that now it's going to freak

1:17:52.400,1:17:55.440
out because we didn't import ad icon so

1:17:54.000,1:17:56.800
i'm going to go ahead and pull in add

1:17:55.440,1:17:59.360
icon from

1:17:56.800,1:18:01.280
material ui like so save

1:17:59.360,1:18:03.040
and then what i'm going to do is refresh

1:18:01.280,1:18:04.719
and you can see that the go here would

1:18:03.040,1:18:06.000
be all of these buttons are actually

1:18:04.719,1:18:07.199
clickable right so i can click them and

1:18:06.000,1:18:09.120
all that sort of stuff and then this one

1:18:07.199,1:18:10.239
if i click it it says please enter a

1:18:09.120,1:18:12.159
channel name so we want some

1:18:10.239,1:18:14.960
functionality behind it how do i

1:18:12.159,1:18:17.199
determine when to sort of pop this up i

1:18:14.960,1:18:19.040
pass another prop and you guessed it

1:18:17.199,1:18:21.120
that prop is going to be the add channel

1:18:19.040,1:18:23.360
option so if i go over to sidebar option

1:18:21.120,1:18:25.040
i'm going to pull that in as a prop okay

1:18:23.360,1:18:25.920
and we'll sort of set that up in just a

1:18:25.040,1:18:27.040
sec

1:18:25.920,1:18:30.000
okay

1:18:27.040,1:18:32.000
perfect now at this point right we have

1:18:30.000,1:18:35.040
the channels over here and then we have

1:18:32.000,1:18:36.640
the final bit underneath now the last

1:18:35.040,1:18:38.159
bit is actually the channels which

1:18:36.640,1:18:41.040
render out so if i was to go ahead and

1:18:38.159,1:18:42.960
add a channel saying um

1:18:41.040,1:18:44.800
let's just say

1:18:42.960,1:18:47.840
let's just say pop fam all right just to

1:18:44.800,1:18:49.520
say pop fam okay and you can see like a

1:18:47.840,1:18:51.280
channel came in here so this one we need

1:18:49.520,1:18:53.120
to go ahead and actually

1:18:51.280,1:18:55.280
sort of set up with a database behind it

1:18:53.120,1:18:57.199
okay so this is actually sort of uh oh

1:18:55.280,1:18:59.360
nice classes guys come on energy from

1:18:57.199,1:19:00.880
twitch nice um

1:18:59.360,1:19:02.000
yeah so you can you see this can be set

1:19:00.880,1:19:05.120
up to a database we're gonna go ahead

1:19:02.000,1:19:07.600
and configure that in just a sec okay so

1:19:05.120,1:19:10.560
what i'm gonna do at this point is i'm

1:19:07.600,1:19:13.199
going to go ahead and style out the hr

1:19:10.560,1:19:15.280
right so i'm going to go into my sidebar

1:19:13.199,1:19:17.120
over here

1:19:15.280,1:19:18.000
and i'm going to go ahead and say start

1:19:17.120,1:19:20.239
bar

1:19:18.000,1:19:22.560
sorry sidebar container and i'm going to

1:19:20.239,1:19:24.239
target the horizontal row which is that

1:19:22.560,1:19:26.480
line and i'm going to give it a margin

1:19:24.239,1:19:28.560
top 10 pixels margin bottom and a border

1:19:26.480,1:19:29.920
of one pixel solid and it's got a nice

1:19:28.560,1:19:32.640
little color to it you guys will see in

1:19:29.920,1:19:35.280
just a sec boom there we go very subtle

1:19:32.640,1:19:36.560
okay very very subtle stuff and then

1:19:35.280,1:19:38.719
what we're gonna do

1:19:36.560,1:19:40.239
is the we've already done the header

1:19:38.719,1:19:41.920
we've already done that blah blah blah

1:19:40.239,1:19:44.960
nice that actually looks pretty damn

1:19:41.920,1:19:47.199
good okay so at this point if i go ahead

1:19:44.960,1:19:49.520
and show you guys look at this

1:19:47.199,1:19:51.440
that's pretty damn close right so we're

1:19:49.520,1:19:52.239
looking pretty good at this point

1:19:51.440,1:19:54.560
okay

1:19:52.239,1:19:56.159
now what we want to do

1:19:54.560,1:19:57.520
is i actually want to firstly create

1:19:56.159,1:19:59.920
these rooms

1:19:57.520,1:20:01.360
okay so how do we create the rooms right

1:19:59.920,1:20:03.040
so

1:20:01.360,1:20:05.520
oh nice

1:20:03.040,1:20:08.480
london uk oh [ __ ]

1:20:05.520,1:20:09.520
i'm in london dude right so uh let's go

1:20:08.480,1:20:11.199
ahead and say

1:20:09.520,1:20:14.239
at this point boom just go and pop this

1:20:11.199,1:20:15.199
halfway put this halfway nice

1:20:14.239,1:20:17.040
okay

1:20:15.199,1:20:20.080
so inside of sidebar option what i'm

1:20:17.040,1:20:22.239
going to do is i'm going to have a add

1:20:20.080,1:20:23.840
channel now what's really cool here

1:20:22.239,1:20:25.840
is that i'm going to basically have it

1:20:23.840,1:20:27.440
so that if you click on this one you add

1:20:25.840,1:20:29.120
a channel if you click on this one

1:20:27.440,1:20:31.199
you're selecting a channel okay so in

1:20:29.120,1:20:33.199
this case if i if i click on this one it

1:20:31.199,1:20:34.400
selects the channel okay it takes a

1:20:33.199,1:20:36.000
little second because the internet's a

1:20:34.400,1:20:37.600
bit slow but if i go ahead and for

1:20:36.000,1:20:39.920
example add a channel how do i do that

1:20:37.600,1:20:42.000
right how do i make it sort of dependent

1:20:39.920,1:20:44.239
on on that sort of thing so

1:20:42.000,1:20:46.560
the way i do that is i go ahead let me

1:20:44.239,1:20:48.000
just make this small for a sec and then

1:20:46.560,1:20:50.400
we make this a bit bigger so we go ahead

1:20:48.000,1:20:51.920
we take our add channel option prop now

1:20:50.400,1:20:54.159
we go to our

1:20:51.920,1:20:57.280
sidebar option container and what i

1:20:54.159,1:21:00.560
simply do is i say okay

1:20:57.280,1:21:03.280
attach and on click right uh but if i

1:21:00.560,1:21:05.520
have add channel option passed as a prop

1:21:03.280,1:21:07.679
i'm going to trigger off the add channel

1:21:05.520,1:21:09.120
function which we need to write or if

1:21:07.679,1:21:11.040
that's actually not there we don't

1:21:09.120,1:21:12.480
actually see this prop in there or it's

1:21:11.040,1:21:13.760
falsies so which means it's not got a

1:21:12.480,1:21:15.679
value behind it i'm gonna select a

1:21:13.760,1:21:17.199
channel instead now these two functions

1:21:15.679,1:21:20.239
i need to create add channel and select

1:21:17.199,1:21:21.920
channel okay so almost at 400 likes guys

1:21:20.239,1:21:23.760
smash the thumbs up button we're almost

1:21:21.920,1:21:24.800
almost there okay now at this point i'm

1:21:23.760,1:21:26.320
going to create two functions we're

1:21:24.800,1:21:27.199
going to create one which is const add

1:21:26.320,1:21:28.560
channel

1:21:27.199,1:21:30.000
and this is going to be an anonymous

1:21:28.560,1:21:31.199
function i'm going to do the same thing

1:21:30.000,1:21:32.400
for select channel i'm going to say con

1:21:31.199,1:21:34.880
select channel

1:21:32.400,1:21:37.280
boom an anonymous function like so

1:21:34.880,1:21:39.360
that's it right we've got two two

1:21:37.280,1:21:40.880
different functions over there

1:21:39.360,1:21:42.880
and uh yeah you shouldn't have any

1:21:40.880,1:21:44.400
errors inside your code at this point

1:21:42.880,1:21:45.280
everything should be looking good 400

1:21:44.400,1:21:48.000
likes

1:21:45.280,1:21:50.080
literally one like away come on guys

1:21:50.080,1:21:56.960
flipping 500 likes and we literally lost

1:21:52.639,1:21:58.159

1:21:56.960,1:21:59.760
that's what i'm talking about guys thank

1:22:21.760,1:22:24.480
that's the kind of energy we need dude

1:22:23.199,1:22:26.000

person that gets one and then everyone

1:22:29.679,1:22:33.679
decides to jump and it's like boom you

1:22:31.840,1:22:35.040
know how it is all right

1:22:33.679,1:22:37.040
all right let's carry on guys so at this

1:22:35.040,1:22:38.400
point we have got the ad channel okay so

1:22:37.040,1:22:40.000
for the ad channel we're gonna do a few

1:22:38.400,1:22:42.000
cool things so now what i need to do is

1:22:40.000,1:22:43.760
set up firebase okay so i'm gonna go

1:22:42.000,1:22:46.080
over to my files earlier and remember we

1:22:43.760,1:22:47.360
added in the firebase configuration okay

1:22:46.080,1:22:48.719
so what i actually need to do is command

1:22:47.360,1:22:52.560
j pull out my terminal i'm gonna say

1:22:48.719,1:22:53.600
yarn add firebase

1:22:52.560,1:22:55.440
all right so yes because we're going to

1:22:53.600,1:22:57.280
install firebase into our project now

1:22:55.440,1:22:58.639
while it's doing that i can go over here

1:22:57.280,1:23:01.280
and i can say

1:22:58.639,1:23:03.120
import firebase from firebase mahmed

1:23:01.280,1:23:05.040
says hey sunny great what man thank you

1:23:03.120,1:23:07.120
so much dude uh sharika let's do it dude

1:23:05.040,1:23:08.400
let's get 500 i think we can do it

1:23:07.120,1:23:09.600
right now what we're going to say is

1:23:08.400,1:23:11.199
while that's installing i already know

1:23:09.600,1:23:14.080
it's right we're going to say firebase

1:23:11.199,1:23:16.560
app equals firebase which is our package

1:23:14.080,1:23:18.239
we just installed dot initialize app and

1:23:16.560,1:23:20.639
the way you set up the app and basically

1:23:18.239,1:23:22.320
what this is doing is it connects the

1:23:20.639,1:23:24.719
the front end that we're building right

1:23:22.320,1:23:26.480
now to firebase so firebase is the thing

1:23:24.719,1:23:28.639
that's powering everything it's google's

1:23:26.480,1:23:30.480
sort of back-end servers and basically

1:23:28.639,1:23:32.400
right now initialize app is going to

1:23:30.480,1:23:33.840
take that configuration and connect

1:23:32.400,1:23:35.120
these two things together all right and

1:23:33.840,1:23:37.040
it makes everything work in the way we

1:23:35.120,1:23:39.040
expect so here i'm going to say firebase

1:23:37.040,1:23:40.960
config

1:23:39.040,1:23:43.280
okay and then i'm going to go ahead and

1:23:40.960,1:23:45.120
say const db because i need access to

1:23:43.280,1:23:47.199
the database now what database am i

1:23:45.120,1:23:48.480
referring to you guys you might be

1:23:47.199,1:23:50.560
wondering so i'm going to go over to my

1:23:48.480,1:23:52.400
firebase i'm going to go into over here

1:23:50.560,1:23:55.120
and i'm going to say cloud firestore

1:23:52.400,1:23:57.199
okay so cloud firestore over here victor

1:23:55.120,1:23:59.199
uh newbleen says you deserve 1 million

1:23:57.199,1:24:00.639
subscribers dude we're not going to stop

1:23:59.199,1:24:03.520
until we get there so i'm telling you

1:24:00.639,1:24:05.520
just keep on going right next right now

1:24:03.520,1:24:06.719
let's go ahead and hit 500 likes that's

1:24:05.520,1:24:08.080
the sort of you know we celebrate all

1:24:06.719,1:24:10.880
this morning you want to click on create

1:24:08.080,1:24:12.480
database start in test mode click next

1:24:10.880,1:24:14.320
here you want to click name enable

1:24:12.480,1:24:15.600
that's fine all good

1:24:14.320,1:24:17.199
right

1:24:15.600,1:24:19.120
so once that's done

1:24:17.199,1:24:21.280
this will go ahead and set up firestore

1:24:19.120,1:24:23.679
right firestore is a real-time database

1:24:21.280,1:24:25.040
now it's so powerful it's real time

1:24:23.679,1:24:26.400
which means as messages come through

1:24:25.040,1:24:27.360
it'll be so easy to implement we're

1:24:26.400,1:24:30.159
going to go ahead and do it really

1:24:27.360,1:24:32.239
nicely right now okay so it says cannot

1:24:30.159,1:24:34.159
enable after you set it though oh

1:24:32.239,1:24:35.679
interesting let's have a look why i

1:24:34.159,1:24:37.199
might actually have to use if it if you

1:24:35.679,1:24:38.880
can't enable it i'll

1:24:37.199,1:24:41.120
i'll go ahead and and use a different

1:24:38.880,1:24:43.040
account that's completely cool

1:24:41.120,1:24:45.600
all right so setting up security rules

1:24:43.040,1:24:45.600
let's out of that

1:24:46.239,1:24:49.920
okay it did that so if you get that

1:24:47.760,1:24:52.080
arrow just go ahead and do it right so

1:24:49.920,1:24:53.679
at this point what i'm going to do is uh

1:24:52.080,1:24:55.920
and guys this is not a gossip channel

1:24:53.679,1:24:57.840
dude so please don't all right so what

1:24:55.920,1:25:00.960
we're going to do is we're going to go

1:24:57.840,1:25:02.960
ahead and this is basically a nosql

1:25:00.960,1:25:05.199
structure right now what does a nosql

1:25:02.960,1:25:07.840
structure look like right nosql pretty

1:25:05.199,1:25:09.840
much has a structure of collection

1:25:07.840,1:25:12.000
right and a collection can have several

1:25:09.840,1:25:14.080
documents okay so it'll have several

1:25:12.000,1:25:15.760
documents now if you don't know about

1:25:14.080,1:25:18.320
this stuff i really recommend you look

1:25:15.760,1:25:20.320
into what nosql databases are like and

1:25:18.320,1:25:21.360
then after a document like you'll have

1:25:20.320,1:25:23.760
several documents so imagine our

1:25:21.360,1:25:26.239
collection was let's say rooms right so

1:25:23.760,1:25:28.320
chat rooms okay every single document

1:25:26.239,1:25:31.440
would represent a different room like a

1:25:28.320,1:25:33.199
different chat room okay now each room

1:25:31.440,1:25:34.800
will have its own collections you see it

1:25:33.199,1:25:36.080
takes a collection document collection

1:25:34.800,1:25:38.000
structure so this one would be a

1:25:36.080,1:25:39.280
collection

1:25:38.000,1:25:40.960
and then in here you would have a

1:25:39.280,1:25:42.159
collection of messages right so this one

1:25:40.960,1:25:44.400
would be like for example would be a

1:25:42.159,1:25:46.000
collection of messages and then this

1:25:44.400,1:25:48.480
would lead to a

1:25:46.000,1:25:50.719
literally again so it would lead to

1:25:48.480,1:25:52.159
all the messages in the form of document

1:25:50.719,1:25:54.639
like documents okay so here you would

1:25:52.159,1:25:55.920
have all the different messages for this

1:25:54.639,1:25:58.320
chat room so you see you have a

1:25:55.920,1:26:00.400
collection of rooms the rooms themselves

1:25:58.320,1:26:02.000
each room will have its own collection

1:26:00.400,1:26:03.840
of messages and then these will be

1:26:02.000,1:26:05.280
rendered out as documents okay so that's

1:26:03.840,1:26:07.760
how it kind of works when you're using

1:26:05.280,1:26:09.440
nosql okay so at this point what we're

1:26:07.760,1:26:10.880
gonna do black knight says just finished

1:26:09.440,1:26:11.840
netflix day three challenge i came here

1:26:10.880,1:26:14.000
for the new build that's what i'm

1:26:11.840,1:26:15.679
talking about dude coming in clutch man

1:26:14.000,1:26:17.440
so at this point we've got the database

1:26:15.679,1:26:19.280
how do i access it okay i say firebase

1:26:17.440,1:26:21.840
app i basically grab this paste it cause

1:26:19.280,1:26:24.000
i'm lazy and then i say dot firestore

1:26:21.840,1:26:25.920
right no no i don't i say firebase app

1:26:24.000,1:26:27.920
yeah dot firestore yeah i do

1:26:25.920,1:26:29.600
almost got lost there right and then i'm

1:26:27.920,1:26:30.960
gonna say const auth because we have a

1:26:29.600,1:26:33.360
sign in in this app so i'm gonna say

1:26:30.960,1:26:34.960
firebase.org and this is how we do it

1:26:33.360,1:26:36.560
now how do i get google authentication

1:26:34.960,1:26:38.639
right what i do is i add in something

1:26:36.560,1:26:40.080
called a provider now all you need to do

1:26:38.639,1:26:41.360
is add in this line right here what this

1:26:40.080,1:26:43.679
does is it gets the google

1:26:41.360,1:26:46.080
authentication provider which is a nice

1:26:43.679,1:26:48.880
little pop-up ready for us okay

1:26:46.080,1:26:50.639
so what i do now is i go over to my

1:26:48.880,1:26:53.520
firebase and i go to authentication the

1:26:50.639,1:26:55.440
tab over here click it

1:26:53.520,1:26:57.199
all right this is insane right that's

1:26:55.440,1:26:58.320
what i'm saying guys honestly like the

1:26:57.199,1:27:00.960
power of the papa phone we have

1:26:58.320,1:27:02.639
literally uh 170 people watching across

1:27:00.960,1:27:05.360
different platforms right now and we

have 421 likes like that's just that

1:27:05.360,1:27:09.040
just shows you how powerful this damn

1:27:07.199,1:27:11.199
community is right like it's incredible

1:27:09.040,1:27:13.280
like i don't see any other channel doing

1:27:11.199,1:27:15.360
this right now authentication click get

1:27:13.280,1:27:16.800
started and then here very simple to get

1:27:15.360,1:27:19.120
this up and running okay what you want

1:27:16.800,1:27:21.120
to do is you want to go to google hit

1:27:19.120,1:27:24.159
this button enable and then you want to

1:27:21.120,1:27:25.199
click on a project support email save

1:27:24.159,1:27:26.639
that's how you enable google

1:27:25.199,1:27:28.239
authentication guys it's literally that

1:27:26.639,1:27:30.000
simple i promise you and it's even

1:27:28.239,1:27:32.080
easier now because we're using firebase

1:27:30.000,1:27:35.040
hooks and they're gonna be your best

1:27:32.080,1:27:37.120
friend i swear to god guys let's hit 500

1:27:35.040,1:27:38.960
likes come on it's gonna be so fun all

1:27:37.120,1:27:40.480
right so we've got this right up now

1:27:38.960,1:27:41.840
running okay so

1:27:40.480,1:27:43.920
this looks pretty good

1:27:41.840,1:27:46.159
and what i'm gonna do now is i need to

1:27:43.920,1:27:48.239
export this stuff so that we can use it

1:27:46.159,1:27:50.080
outside so i'm going to say export

1:27:48.239,1:27:52.159
and i'm going to exploit explicitly i'm

1:27:50.080,1:27:54.159
going to export the authentication the

1:27:52.159,1:27:56.000
provider and the db this means that i

1:27:54.159,1:27:57.280
can access the db from anywhere i can

1:27:56.000,1:27:59.679
access the authentication and i can

1:27:57.280,1:28:01.760
access a little pop-up anywhere okay so

1:27:59.679,1:28:03.440
this is going to be uh really important

1:28:01.760,1:28:04.639
work says i learn more from sunny than

1:28:03.440,1:28:06.080
in university dude that's what i'm

1:28:04.639,1:28:08.480
talking about man that's what i want to

1:28:06.080,1:28:10.880
do you know that's my mission to just

1:28:08.480,1:28:13.280
drive a value right let's get this

1:28:10.880,1:28:15.199
energy back up quick water break if you

1:28:13.280,1:28:16.880

1:28:16.880,1:28:22.680
and let's let's have it together

1:28:19.679,1:28:24.320
sounded weird but you know

1:28:22.680,1:28:25.280
[Music]

1:28:24.320,1:28:27.440
all right

1:28:25.280,1:28:29.120
change the lighting a little bit

1:28:27.440,1:28:31.360
change a little tempo to this right

1:28:29.120,1:28:32.719
let's carry on guys

1:28:31.360,1:28:35.199
okay

1:28:32.719,1:28:38.159
so at this point we're gonna go ahead

1:28:35.199,1:28:40.400
and jump into our sidebar option

1:28:38.159,1:28:42.800
okay say to say teacher t break four

1:28:40.400,1:28:45.199
axes nice red bull break oh i don't know

1:28:42.800,1:28:46.960
it's dangerous for me dude six o'clock

1:28:45.199,1:28:48.000
i do want to sleep tonight

1:28:46.960,1:28:49.840
all right so at this point what we're

1:28:48.000,1:28:51.679
going to do is i'm going to actually add

1:28:49.840,1:28:54.320
in so firstly we're going to do the add

1:28:51.679,1:28:56.000
channel now how do we add a channel to

1:28:54.320,1:28:58.000
that database structure that i showed

1:28:56.000,1:28:59.360
you earlier before we actually do that i

1:28:58.000,1:29:01.520
want to add i want to show you guys a

1:28:59.360,1:29:03.199
little trick okay so if you go to rules

1:29:01.520,1:29:04.800
over here now don't do this in

1:29:03.199,1:29:06.400
production environments this is only for

1:29:04.800,1:29:07.920
demos or something on your portfolio

1:29:06.400,1:29:09.360
that don't really matter but i'm going

1:29:07.920,1:29:10.880
to make it so that anyone can read and

1:29:09.360,1:29:12.960
write to this database you shouldn't do

1:29:10.880,1:29:14.239
that for production okay if you should

1:29:12.960,1:29:16.320
only have it and i'm not gonna go into

1:29:14.239,1:29:17.440
the security rules right now but it's

1:29:16.320,1:29:19.040
very important that you don't do that in

1:29:17.440,1:29:20.639
production environments let's go ahead

1:29:19.040,1:29:22.880
and go back to data so how do i go ahead

1:29:20.639,1:29:24.719
and add rooms right so what rooms am i

1:29:22.880,1:29:26.719
talking about exactly i'm talking about

1:29:24.719,1:29:28.320
these rooms so like youtube papa fam

1:29:26.719,1:29:29.760
papa how do you get all these different

1:29:28.320,1:29:31.199
channels right

1:29:29.760,1:29:32.800
and eventually if you guys stick it to

1:29:31.199,1:29:34.880
the end you will be able to actually go

1:29:32.800,1:29:36.320
ahead and jump onto the chat we can all

1:29:34.880,1:29:38.639
have a chat through the app which would

1:29:36.320,1:29:40.080
be pretty cool okay fantanus is still in

1:29:38.639,1:29:42.320
love with that water bottle honestly

1:29:40.080,1:29:44.320
dude i love this what well

1:29:42.320,1:29:46.080
i have so many of these um so i'm gonna

1:29:44.320,1:29:47.840
say add channel and then here what i'm

1:29:46.080,1:29:49.280
gonna do is i'm gonna say okay

1:29:47.840,1:29:50.719
what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna say const

1:29:49.280,1:29:51.920
channel name and how do i get the

1:29:50.719,1:29:53.760
channel name right what i'm going to do

1:29:51.920,1:29:55.040
is i'm going to say prompt okay so i'm

1:29:53.760,1:29:56.719
actually going to prompt the user and

1:29:55.040,1:29:58.480
that's actually built in so we can say

1:29:56.719,1:30:00.320
please enter the channel name right so

1:29:58.480,1:30:02.560
please enter the channel

1:30:00.320,1:30:04.400
name okay now what you want to do is

1:30:02.560,1:30:06.560
whenever you prompt the user you need to

1:30:04.400,1:30:09.040
protect against the empty so some people

1:30:06.560,1:30:11.040
might go ahead and prompt but then go

1:30:09.040,1:30:12.560
ahead and

1:30:11.040,1:30:14.800
enter it without value or you want to

1:30:12.560,1:30:16.400
protect against that uh this is a pre

1:30:14.800,1:30:18.159
this is a more upgraded version of the

1:30:16.400,1:30:20.960
previous slack clone yes so here we say

1:30:18.159,1:30:22.960
if and then we say channel name

1:30:20.960,1:30:25.280
right if channel name and if the channel

1:30:22.960,1:30:27.360
name has a value then we access the

1:30:25.280,1:30:29.360
database because basically remember that

1:30:27.360,1:30:30.800
firebase that we the configuration we

1:30:29.360,1:30:32.560
set up earlier then we exported it so

1:30:30.800,1:30:33.920
i'm going to pull in my database

1:30:32.560,1:30:35.920
and i'm just going to say and i'm

1:30:33.920,1:30:38.719
importing it from my local firebase file

1:30:35.920,1:30:41.120
i'm going to say db dot collection and

1:30:38.719,1:30:42.400
the collection is going to be the rooms

1:30:41.120,1:30:45.040
and what i'm going to do is i'm going to

1:30:42.400,1:30:46.320
add a room okay

1:30:45.040,1:30:47.280
find heart thank you so much dude i'm

1:30:46.320,1:30:48.960
going to add a room and they're

1:30:47.280,1:30:50.560
basically adding a room so it's very

1:30:48.960,1:30:52.480
simple you add an object right you just

1:30:50.560,1:30:53.920
simply go ahead and pop in the name of

1:30:52.480,1:30:55.199
this room is going to be the channel

1:30:53.920,1:30:57.040
name that i just collected from the

1:30:55.199,1:30:58.560
prompt now let's go ahead and see this

1:30:57.040,1:31:00.239
in action over on the other one so if we

1:30:58.560,1:31:01.679
go ahead and say add a channel and here

1:31:00.239,1:31:02.639
you can see if i say like uh let's just

1:31:01.679,1:31:03.840
say

1:31:02.639,1:31:05.199
uh

1:31:03.840,1:31:07.040
coding

1:31:05.199,1:31:09.040
enter you can see coding right so how do

1:31:07.040,1:31:11.280
i go ahead and do that so

1:31:09.040,1:31:13.360
i'm gonna say channel name and hit save

1:31:11.280,1:31:15.199
now on our build over here if i go ahead

1:31:13.360,1:31:17.600
and hit add channel and i need to

1:31:15.199,1:31:19.199
refresh most likely

1:31:17.600,1:31:21.520
and what we actually need to do is in

1:31:19.199,1:31:22.560
sidebar add channel option i passed it

1:31:21.520,1:31:24.960
through

1:31:22.560,1:31:26.480
we pass in over here there we go and if

1:31:24.960,1:31:28.159
i go ahead and click add channel now

1:31:26.480,1:31:30.239
please enter the channel name so if i

1:31:28.159,1:31:32.159
say abc emerson says most friendly guy

literally nearly up 450 likes let's go

1:31:34.560,1:31:38.800
and let's get okay perfect okay so it

1:31:37.120,1:31:40.880
worked in the way we expected it to but

1:31:38.800,1:31:43.440
nothing really happened all right saita

1:31:40.880,1:31:45.600
just said suddenly i got five jobs wow

1:31:43.440,1:31:46.719
oh my god dude just send me brew for

1:31:48.560,1:31:52.880
what it is i love this damn song man

1:31:51.199,1:31:53.920
all right so now we pretty much go ahead

1:31:52.880,1:31:55.280
and have a nice little prompt at this

1:31:53.920,1:31:56.719
point okay

1:31:55.280,1:32:00.719
all right so

1:31:56.719,1:32:03.760
450 likes let's go man oh my god this

1:32:00.719,1:32:05.360
channel was insane honestly let's go

1:32:03.760,1:32:06.880
all right so this will go ahead and add

1:32:05.360,1:32:08.719
it now i actually just went ahead and

1:32:06.880,1:32:09.760
tried that out so let's see if i added

1:32:08.719,1:32:12.080
it to database so i'm going to hit

1:32:09.760,1:32:14.800
refresh on the cloud firestore database

1:32:12.080,1:32:16.960
we should see rooms

1:32:14.800,1:32:18.159
rooms there we go and we see abc that

1:32:16.960,1:32:19.840
was the room that we just created all

1:32:18.159,1:32:22.960
right awesome stuff so we actually went

1:32:19.840,1:32:24.639
ahead and pushed it into our back end

1:32:22.960,1:32:26.560
okay so that looks really really nice at

1:32:24.639,1:32:30.000
this point in time now

1:32:26.560,1:32:31.920
how do i actually go ahead and then

1:32:30.000,1:32:33.520
list them out on the sidebar though

1:32:31.920,1:32:35.440
right so it's all farewell that we add

1:32:33.520,1:32:37.440
them but how do i actually use them

1:32:35.440,1:32:39.520
now previously we had to use some kind

1:32:37.440,1:32:41.440
of jankies effect and if you've ever

1:32:39.520,1:32:43.600
seen any of my builds it's kind of a

1:32:41.440,1:32:45.280
headache to do that okay so instead what

1:32:43.600,1:32:46.239
we're going to be doing now because what

1:32:45.280,1:32:48.320
i want to do is i want to have a

1:32:46.239,1:32:50.000
real-time listener to that database

1:32:48.320,1:32:52.560
which will allow me to basically pull

1:32:50.000,1:32:54.400
this in in a real-time fashion okay so

1:32:52.560,1:32:56.880
what i'm going to do here

1:32:54.400,1:32:58.320
is uh oh nice haha he's shazamed it

1:32:56.880,1:32:59.520
thank you dude so what i'm going to do

1:32:58.320,1:33:02.639
here is i'm actually going to go ahead

1:32:59.520,1:33:03.920
and say um firebase

1:33:02.639,1:33:06.000
hooks

1:33:03.920,1:33:07.600
and save and you can see react firebase

1:33:06.000,1:33:09.120
hooks right you're going to click the

1:33:07.600,1:33:10.480
first link and all you need to do to get

1:33:09.120,1:33:12.800
this up and running you guys can feel

1:33:10.480,1:33:14.159
free to read that documentation but all

1:33:12.800,1:33:18.400
i'm going to do is go ahead and command

1:33:14.159,1:33:19.600
j yarn add react firebase hooks

1:33:18.400,1:33:21.120
so i'm going to install this okay and

1:33:19.600,1:33:22.080
this is the one that you want to install

1:33:21.120,1:33:23.840
now they have a really great

1:33:22.080,1:33:26.239
documentation there and here's the sort

1:33:23.840,1:33:28.080
of useful links that show you how to use

1:33:26.239,1:33:29.840
each one so the authentication has cloud

1:33:28.080,1:33:33.040
files to hooks but you guys are going to

1:33:29.840,1:33:34.320
see the absolute crazy power okay you're

1:33:33.040,1:33:36.480
going to see honestly the crazy power of

1:33:34.320,1:33:38.159
this right now so it's already installed

1:33:36.480,1:33:39.520
so we hit command j to hide it and now

1:33:38.159,1:33:41.280
what we do is we go to the top of our

1:33:39.520,1:33:44.159
file where we typically would have you

1:33:41.280,1:33:47.360
know defined some state right but what

1:33:44.159,1:33:50.239
we do here is we say const

1:33:47.360,1:33:51.600
we want the channels from firestore okay

1:33:50.239,1:33:52.880
so something i don't really see what

1:33:51.600,1:33:54.639
you're doing here so we're going to get

1:33:52.880,1:33:56.320
the channels and what's actually even

1:33:54.639,1:33:57.679
better we can get the loading state even

1:33:56.320,1:33:58.800
when it's loading and if there's an

1:33:57.679,1:34:00.639
error we can actually get the error

1:33:58.800,1:34:01.920
state all right so this is getting this

1:34:00.639,1:34:03.360
is kind of getting powerful saying what

1:34:01.920,1:34:06.639
are you doing here right and then here

1:34:03.360,1:34:07.920
we say equals use collection

1:34:06.639,1:34:09.840
okay

1:34:07.920,1:34:11.920
views collection and some of you

1:34:09.840,1:34:13.679
watching like i'm listening i'm kind of

1:34:11.920,1:34:15.920
listening was this happening and let's

1:34:13.679,1:34:18.880
go ahead and import that right from the

1:34:15.920,1:34:20.639
react firebase hooks and then how do we

1:34:18.880,1:34:21.520
go ahead and access the collection so

1:34:20.639,1:34:23.520
i'm actually going to go ahead and

1:34:21.520,1:34:25.040
access this collection right now and i'm

1:34:23.520,1:34:26.560
trying to get the channels right which

1:34:25.040,1:34:27.360
is actually the rooms right so in this

1:34:26.560,1:34:29.280
case

1:34:27.360,1:34:30.880
the naming's a bit off but that's what

1:34:29.280,1:34:32.560
we're referring to madhu says you have a

1:34:30.880,1:34:34.639
lot of energy man thank you so much dude

1:34:32.560,1:34:36.560
you guys give me that energy and here

1:34:34.639,1:34:38.320
what i do is i say db

1:34:36.560,1:34:40.239
right so i'm going to go ahead and pull

1:34:38.320,1:34:42.400
in my db which i already have and i will

1:34:40.239,1:34:44.800
say db.collection

1:34:42.400,1:34:47.040
and i'm just going to point to the rooms

1:34:44.800,1:34:50.800
and you better goddamn believe it that

1:34:47.040,1:34:52.320
that is it now in channels i have the

1:34:50.800,1:34:54.000
collections

1:34:52.320,1:34:55.679
so if i go ahead and i just say let's

1:34:54.000,1:34:58.639
just do a console log

1:34:55.679,1:35:00.719
of channels here and i go ahead and do f

1:34:58.639,1:35:03.199
command f12 to show this look at this

1:35:00.719,1:35:04.960
guys that is actually

1:35:03.199,1:35:07.040
there's actually the uh the channels

1:35:04.960,1:35:08.560
right there so if i do docs an array of

1:35:07.040,1:35:09.679
one and it looks weird right now but

1:35:08.560,1:35:10.960
i'll show you that i'll prove to you

1:35:09.679,1:35:13.679
that that is actually what we're looking

1:35:10.960,1:35:15.679
for right so this is this is incredible

1:35:13.679,1:35:17.119
right this is really really incredible

1:35:15.679,1:35:18.400
uh finnair says it's been an hour you're

1:35:17.119,1:35:19.679
nearly finished yet you went at a pace

1:35:18.400,1:35:21.440
and made me understand thanks a lot

1:35:19.679,1:35:23.119
thank you so much man honestly like i

1:35:21.440,1:35:25.679
really appreciate the kind words

1:35:23.119,1:35:27.930
um surendra recognize me bro

1:35:25.679,1:35:29.600
right so let's carry on um

1:35:27.930,1:35:31.600
[Music]

1:35:29.600,1:35:32.800
and what we're gonna do now is we're

1:35:31.600,1:35:33.600
gonna go ahead get rid of that console

1:35:32.800,1:35:36.000
log

1:35:33.600,1:35:37.600
and i'm gonna go ahead and say so we

1:35:36.000,1:35:39.440
have the channels over there right now i

1:35:37.600,1:35:43.199
wanna loop through them and show them as

1:35:39.440,1:35:45.840
sidebar options okay so how do i do that

1:35:43.199,1:35:47.920
what i want to do is each actual sort of

1:35:45.840,1:35:50.159
room has an id as well so i will be

1:35:47.920,1:35:52.239
passing that as an another additional

1:35:50.159,1:35:54.639
prop to my sidebar option but what i

1:35:52.239,1:35:56.560
need to do here is go back to sidebar

1:35:54.639,1:35:58.560
and i'm going to go over here and i'm

1:35:56.560,1:36:01.040
going to say okay

1:35:58.560,1:36:02.800
go into the channels right go into the

1:36:01.040,1:36:04.000
docs and remember channels can be

1:36:02.800,1:36:05.040
undefined in the beginning so we're

1:36:04.000,1:36:07.679
going to protect it with something

1:36:05.040,1:36:09.679
called optional chaining right then we

1:36:07.679,1:36:11.040
say dot right how are you using react

1:36:09.679,1:36:12.560
just without having stack overflow open

1:36:11.040,1:36:14.080
the next page real programmer respect

1:36:12.560,1:36:16.320
thank you dude honestly just practice

1:36:14.080,1:36:18.480
takes a lot of practice and uh

1:36:16.320,1:36:20.960
my course right once you take it you

1:36:18.480,1:36:22.639
understand react inside out all right

1:36:20.960,1:36:24.159
there's a sale one by the way guys two

1:36:22.639,1:36:25.840
days left first link in description

1:36:24.159,1:36:27.199
check it out if you're interested right

1:36:25.840,1:36:29.840
here we're gonna say uh

1:36:27.199,1:36:30.719
channels.docs.map

1:36:29.840,1:36:33.360
okay

1:36:30.719,1:36:34.400
uh so all the audiences sees i'm sorry i

1:36:33.360,1:36:36.239
didn't pronounce right that's through

1:36:34.400,1:36:37.760
them yes i'm gonna map through them dude

1:36:36.239,1:36:39.920
so i'm gonna go ahead and say map for

1:36:37.760,1:36:41.040
each one and each of the documents what

1:36:39.920,1:36:42.719
i'm going to do is i'm going to go ahead

1:36:41.040,1:36:44.000
and return something

1:36:42.719,1:36:46.080
so what i want to do is i want to return

1:36:44.000,1:36:47.520
through this entire list and basically

1:36:46.080,1:36:48.719
render out a sidebar option so i'm going

1:36:47.520,1:36:50.480
to go ahead and pop a cyber option

1:36:48.719,1:36:52.159
obviously i don't want this one i

1:36:50.480,1:36:55.119
actually just wanted the i don't want

1:36:52.159,1:36:57.360
the icon here what i want instead is i

1:36:55.119,1:36:59.760
want to say okay the title

1:36:57.360,1:37:02.239
should be

1:36:59.760,1:37:04.159
the doc dot data

1:37:02.239,1:37:05.119
so i'm going to access the data which is

1:37:04.159,1:37:07.679
this

1:37:05.119,1:37:09.600
data inside of a document and i'm going

1:37:07.679,1:37:11.920
to say dot name which was actually the

1:37:09.600,1:37:14.639
name that i gave it here so dot name

1:37:11.920,1:37:16.080
right so a little typo dot name okay

1:37:14.639,1:37:18.480
that's the first thing now whenever you

1:37:16.080,1:37:20.800
have a map inside of react you should

1:37:18.480,1:37:22.159
always provide a key right now keys are

1:37:20.800,1:37:24.080
very important because it tells react

1:37:22.159,1:37:25.920
that you do not need to re-render that

1:37:24.080,1:37:26.880
entire list if something gets added in

1:37:25.920,1:37:28.320
because

1:37:26.880,1:37:30.080
let's say it rendered a thousand

1:37:28.320,1:37:32.800
elements in the list and you only want

1:37:30.080,1:37:34.239
to you only add in one extra sort of

1:37:32.800,1:37:36.080
element to that list because every

1:37:34.239,1:37:38.480
single one has a different key now react

1:37:36.080,1:37:40.800
knows oh wait a sec you only added

1:37:38.480,1:37:42.320
something at the bottom the other 52

1:37:40.800,1:37:44.239
that you added before don't need to be

1:37:42.320,1:37:45.679
re-rendered so it makes it a lot more

1:37:44.239,1:37:48.639
efficient okay

1:37:45.679,1:37:50.719
so here i say the key is dot doc id

1:37:48.639,1:37:52.560
right and the document id is going to be

1:37:50.719,1:37:53.760
this one so at this point what can i do

1:37:52.560,1:37:55.040
i can say actually i'm going to pass

1:37:53.760,1:37:57.760
through an id which is going to be the

1:37:55.040,1:38:00.080
doctor id because i actually need this

1:37:57.760,1:38:01.600
id as a prop and i'll show you why okay

1:38:00.080,1:38:03.920
i'll show you exactly why

1:38:01.600,1:38:07.360
channels is not defined that's because

1:38:03.920,1:38:09.679
um oh wait a sec in sidebar options

1:38:07.360,1:38:11.600
um oh i've done it in the wrong room

1:38:09.679,1:38:13.280
there we go this needs to be inside bar

1:38:11.600,1:38:15.679
my bad so this should be inside bar

1:38:13.280,1:38:17.360
right now there we go inside bar and

1:38:15.679,1:38:19.920
then this means that the use collection

1:38:17.360,1:38:22.159
should also be inside bar okay so this

1:38:19.920,1:38:24.960
one should also be in here which means

1:38:22.159,1:38:26.400
we also need to import db

1:38:24.960,1:38:28.000
so make sure you just follow me with

1:38:26.400,1:38:30.159
that one there's a slight little change

1:38:28.000,1:38:32.880
it should be in sidebar okay harpery

1:38:30.159,1:38:35.360
what's up man good to see bro

1:38:32.880,1:38:36.880
that's my brother-in-law's that's just

1:38:35.360,1:38:38.480
here's my brother in the house there we

1:38:36.880,1:38:39.840
go all right

1:38:38.480,1:38:41.280
and then here we're gonna say channels

1:38:39.840,1:38:42.480
there we go and you got the channels it

1:38:41.280,1:38:44.800
says channels is not defined but if we

1:38:42.480,1:38:46.000
save now when we refresh should be good

1:38:44.800,1:38:46.960
all right so now you can see like the

1:38:46.000,1:38:49.760
channels

1:38:46.960,1:38:51.600
but ah there we go guys abc there we go

1:38:49.760,1:38:53.520
look at that works right i mean it looks

1:38:51.600,1:38:56.480
like trash but we'll make it look nice

1:38:53.520,1:38:58.000
um so at this point like it does not

1:38:56.480,1:38:59.280
look great but we're gonna make that

1:38:58.000,1:39:01.280
look a little bit better we're gonna

1:38:59.280,1:39:02.239
make that look very clean in the end

1:39:01.280,1:39:04.159
okay

1:39:02.239,1:39:05.840
so how do i get this to look in the way

1:39:04.159,1:39:07.520
that i have option so i'm heading over

1:39:05.840,1:39:08.880
to sidebar option i'm passing through

1:39:07.520,1:39:10.159
the id

1:39:08.880,1:39:11.920
okay so make sure you don't forget that

1:39:10.159,1:39:13.840
step is very important now inside the

1:39:11.920,1:39:16.400
sidebar option okay

1:39:13.840,1:39:18.000
uh that's it harps is in the house man

1:39:16.400,1:39:20.960
so what we're gonna do is where we have

1:39:18.000,1:39:22.800
the h3 okay so this is going to be the

1:39:20.960,1:39:24.800
sidebar option channel so we need to

1:39:22.800,1:39:26.719
style sidebar option channel which is

1:39:24.800,1:39:29.360
why it looks like trash right now so i'm

1:39:26.719,1:39:30.239
gonna go over to sidebar option channel

1:39:29.360,1:39:33.040
and

1:39:30.239,1:39:34.560
where is that sidebar option channel

1:39:33.040,1:39:36.320
there we go okay so this is gonna be a

1:39:34.560,1:39:38.000
slight this is not gonna be a div it's

1:39:36.320,1:39:39.920
gonna be a h3

1:39:38.000,1:39:42.000
okay because this is going to be and a

1:39:39.920,1:39:43.520
sort of h3 so you see what we're doing

1:39:42.000,1:39:44.880
there's really good right action says

1:39:43.520,1:39:46.719
hey son you just joined you are amazing

1:39:44.880,1:39:48.960
thank you so much dude uh hardik says

1:39:46.719,1:39:51.440
you're on fire thank you man we're

1:39:48.960,1:39:53.840
literally about to break 500 likes come

1:39:51.440,1:39:55.280
on guys just keep on going it's so so

1:39:53.840,1:39:56.480
cool and i love how everyone chats to

1:39:55.280,1:39:58.159
each other starts to get to know each

1:39:56.480,1:39:59.600
other so nice all right so here i'm

1:39:58.159,1:40:02.400
going to say padding

1:39:59.600,1:40:03.760
of 10 pixels by zero so 10 pixels by

1:40:02.400,1:40:05.199
zero i'm going to say a font weight of

1:40:03.760,1:40:07.280
300.

1:40:05.199,1:40:09.040
whoa

1:40:07.280,1:40:12.800
check out ancho sing he says i have

1:40:09.040,1:40:14.480
landed a 100k job thank you that's

1:40:12.800,1:40:15.280
it man that's what we do that's what we

1:40:14.480,1:40:16.239
do

1:40:15.280,1:40:18.080
right

1:40:16.239,1:40:21.440
if you if the room's collection has only

1:40:18.080,1:40:23.760
an id how did you extract channels um no

1:40:21.440,1:40:25.679
so it doesn't have an id these are the

1:40:23.760,1:40:27.920
channels this is going to be like a doc

1:40:25.679,1:40:29.679
these are all channels so the room all

1:40:27.920,1:40:31.600
of these documents would be the channels

1:40:29.679,1:40:33.280
and then the doc.data would be the data

1:40:31.600,1:40:35.040
inside of each one okay

1:40:33.280,1:40:36.880
so let's go ahead and save and then you

1:40:35.040,1:40:38.719
see guys that looks pretty clean okay

1:40:36.880,1:40:40.400
but you see look at that oh

1:40:38.719,1:40:43.360
it shouldn't be triggering it should

1:40:40.400,1:40:45.280
only be triggering on the abc

1:40:43.360,1:40:46.960
it should it shouldn't be triggering on

1:40:45.280,1:40:48.560
this one right so we've got a problem

1:40:46.960,1:40:50.320
there so

1:40:48.560,1:40:52.960
the problem there is we've got a channel

1:40:50.320,1:40:55.280
option but what we need to actually do

1:40:52.960,1:40:57.360
is say

1:40:55.280,1:40:58.960
select channel

1:40:57.360,1:41:01.199
okay

1:40:58.960,1:41:03.199
so at this point what we need to do is

1:41:01.199,1:41:05.280
say

1:41:03.199,1:41:07.280
well we have select channel

1:41:05.280,1:41:08.960
so now what i'm going to do is firstly

1:41:07.280,1:41:11.040
this should this is oh oops if we go to

1:41:08.960,1:41:13.600
sidebar we don't need the add channel

1:41:11.040,1:41:15.199
option here we don't want that

1:41:13.600,1:41:17.199
we refresh

1:41:15.199,1:41:19.520
and you should have it so that only the

1:41:17.199,1:41:20.800
ad channel makes the pop-up come up if

1:41:19.520,1:41:22.080
you click this one it shouldn't make it

1:41:20.800,1:41:23.920
pop up because what we actually want to

1:41:22.080,1:41:26.239
do is trigger off the

1:41:23.920,1:41:29.199
select channel function okay so there we

1:41:26.239,1:41:31.040
go right so now what i'm going to do

1:41:29.199,1:41:33.840
is

1:41:31.040,1:41:35.440
um curious says uh so this is a much

1:41:33.840,1:41:37.199
more upgraded slack clone so this has

1:41:35.440,1:41:38.159
style components redox and firebase

1:41:37.199,1:41:40.159
hooks so

1:41:38.159,1:41:41.520
i love a lot more all right

1:41:40.159,1:41:42.960
um

1:41:41.520,1:41:44.800
all right let's carry on guys so select

1:41:42.960,1:41:45.920
channel so inside the sec channel what

1:41:44.800,1:41:48.639
i'm gonna do is this is where i'm gonna

1:41:45.920,1:41:51.199
use redux so what i wanna do is every

1:41:48.639,1:41:53.679
time we select a room i wanna push the

1:41:51.199,1:41:55.840
id into my redux right

1:41:53.679,1:41:57.520
now what is redux right redux is like a

1:41:55.840,1:41:58.960
global store so

1:41:57.520,1:42:00.960
think of our application where every

1:41:58.960,1:42:03.040
single component has state which is like

1:42:00.960,1:42:03.920
some kind of memory inside of it right

1:42:03.040,1:42:06.320
now

1:42:03.920,1:42:08.480
if i need some memory to exist and kind

1:42:06.320,1:42:10.480
of float around my entire app and i just

1:42:08.480,1:42:12.159
need to pull it when i need to redox is

1:42:10.480,1:42:14.080
basically it's going to solve that

1:42:12.159,1:42:16.159
problem for us it's going to act as

1:42:14.080,1:42:18.000
something like a global store it's going

1:42:16.159,1:42:20.719
to be like a global place where we can

1:42:18.000,1:42:23.199
access and store variables now how do we

1:42:20.719,1:42:25.199
push data into redux we dispatch

1:42:23.199,1:42:27.520
something called an action which allows

1:42:25.199,1:42:30.000
us to manipulate the sort of data which

1:42:27.520,1:42:31.600
lies inside the redux slices now what we

1:42:30.000,1:42:32.960
do is in today's build we're only going

1:42:31.600,1:42:34.560
to have one slice which is just going to

1:42:32.960,1:42:37.119
refer to all the app contents but you

1:42:34.560,1:42:38.560
can actually divide that global store up

1:42:37.119,1:42:39.920
in things that make sense let's say you

1:42:38.560,1:42:42.560
had an e-commerce site you could have a

1:42:39.920,1:42:45.040
basket slice a user slice and all that

1:42:42.560,1:42:46.400
cool stuff okay so a lot a lot to learn

1:42:45.040,1:42:47.600
here and it's gonna be a lot of fun okay

1:42:46.400,1:42:50.080
so what we're gonna do now is actually

1:42:47.600,1:42:51.679
prepare redux and it's gonna be a lot

1:42:50.080,1:42:53.199
simpler than you think okay so let's go

1:42:51.679,1:42:55.679
ahead and jump into that

1:42:53.199,1:42:57.600
so i'm gonna go over to my code

1:42:55.679,1:42:59.520
and i'm going to go ahead and say where

1:42:57.600,1:43:00.639
we have oh and you'll sing thank you so

1:42:59.520,1:43:02.320
much dude

1:43:00.639,1:43:03.840
it does not matter if it's uh he says

1:43:02.320,1:43:06.080
it's a small donation but dude any

1:43:03.840,1:43:08.480
donation is massively appreciated thank

1:43:06.080,1:43:11.480
you so much so here we have

1:43:08.480,1:43:11.480
um

1:43:11.600,1:43:15.679
how's this chatting away to everyone

1:43:13.119,1:43:17.280
here we go in app store.js so i want to

1:43:15.679,1:43:19.440
rename this to not be the counter

1:43:17.280,1:43:21.360
reducer i'm going to rename all of these

1:43:19.440,1:43:23.600
things to become app reducer so i'm

1:43:21.360,1:43:25.119
going to have one kind of global store

1:43:23.600,1:43:26.719
inside of this build but typically you

1:43:25.119,1:43:28.400
should spread it out based on like you

1:43:26.719,1:43:30.320
know what's in the basket what's in the

1:43:28.400,1:43:32.000
sort of user information that sort of

1:43:30.320,1:43:32.880
stuff so at this point i need to go to

1:43:32.000,1:43:33.920
my

1:43:32.880,1:43:36.639
um

1:43:33.920,1:43:38.320
i need to go to my features

1:43:36.639,1:43:41.760
click that and i'm going to rename

1:43:38.320,1:43:44.480
counter slice to become app slice

1:43:41.760,1:43:45.760
right app slice there we go right

1:43:44.480,1:43:48.560
perfect now i'm going to jump into app

1:43:45.760,1:43:50.159
slice and over here what i need to do is

1:43:48.560,1:43:51.600
i need to start renaming this so i'm

1:43:50.159,1:43:53.600
going to rename these two things to

1:43:51.600,1:43:55.040
become app and then i'm going to go here

1:43:53.600,1:43:57.360
and this is actually going to become

1:43:55.040,1:43:59.600
room id this is the initial state of

1:43:57.360,1:44:01.280
that global store right now i just have

1:43:59.600,1:44:03.360
a room id which by default in the

1:44:01.280,1:44:05.040
beginning is going to be no it's not

1:44:03.360,1:44:08.159
going to have a value okay

1:44:05.040,1:44:09.679
um right so please don't spam dude um

1:44:08.159,1:44:10.639
you're gonna get blocked so sorry about

1:44:09.679,1:44:13.199
that dude

1:44:10.639,1:44:15.520
um so at this point what i'm gonna do is

1:44:13.199,1:44:16.960
i'm gonna go ahead and say

1:44:15.520,1:44:20.000
let's go down here i'm gonna get rid of

1:44:16.960,1:44:21.840
this increment async there we go boom

1:44:20.000,1:44:23.760
and then i'm going to go ahead and

1:44:21.840,1:44:26.000
actually change this up a little bit so

1:44:23.760,1:44:27.920
where we have features down here

1:44:26.000,1:44:29.600
i'm going to change this to have uh sort

1:44:27.920,1:44:31.199
of an action and let's think about what

1:44:29.600,1:44:34.000
is the action when we click that button

1:44:31.199,1:44:36.080
we kind of want to enter the room okay

1:44:34.000,1:44:38.320
and by entering the room what i'm going

1:44:36.080,1:44:40.560
to do is i'm going to take the id okay

1:44:38.320,1:44:42.400
i'm going to take the id of the sort of

1:44:40.560,1:44:44.159
the the sidebar option i just click so

1:44:42.400,1:44:46.080
the room i'm going to get the id and

1:44:44.159,1:44:48.800
basically push it into the store with

1:44:46.080,1:44:50.239
the enter room action okay so let's go

1:44:48.800,1:44:51.440
ahead and do that right now so i'm gonna

1:44:50.239,1:44:53.360
get rid of these two actions we don't

1:44:51.440,1:44:55.360
need them right now okay and every

1:44:53.360,1:44:57.360
single action inside this reducers

1:44:55.360,1:44:58.400
section is these are the actions okay so

1:44:57.360,1:45:00.480
i'm gonna go ahead and get rid of this

1:44:58.400,1:45:02.880
comment and all we're gonna do here is

1:45:00.480,1:45:05.280
essentially go ahead and have i don't

1:45:02.880,1:45:06.480
know why my kite just opened up strange

1:45:05.280,1:45:08.000
um

1:45:06.480,1:45:11.600
so i'm gonna oh

1:45:08.000,1:45:15.360
we just hit 500 likes thank you so much

1:45:11.600,1:45:17.600
guys that's incredible man 181 people

1:45:15.360,1:45:20.000
watching we have 500 likes on this let's

1:45:17.600,1:45:22.880
hit 600 now let's keep on going man that

1:45:20.000,1:45:24.800
is insane let's keep on going so so cool

1:45:22.880,1:45:26.480
honestly and the fact that we had a cut

1:45:24.800,1:45:28.080
out with the tech issue

1:45:26.480,1:45:29.760
doesn't stop us man like we've got the

1:45:28.080,1:45:31.600
whole video up after this build is

1:45:29.760,1:45:33.360
finished it's gonna be perfect you know

1:45:31.600,1:45:35.600
we don't let this stuff ruin us and guys

1:45:33.360,1:45:37.280
as i said before there's a two day sale

1:45:35.600,1:45:38.800
left right you have two days to

1:45:37.280,1:45:40.560
capitalize on that so first link in the

1:45:38.800,1:45:42.639
description christopher made the right

1:45:40.560,1:45:45.440
choice today jumped in but anyway guys

1:45:42.639,1:45:48.159
congrats we hit 500 let's keep on going

1:45:45.440,1:45:49.520
all right so for the enter room action

1:45:48.159,1:45:51.119
okay so we're going to say enter room is

1:45:49.520,1:45:52.080
going to be our action and this one is

1:45:51.119,1:45:53.520
going to have

1:45:52.080,1:45:55.199
whenever you dispatch an action you get

1:45:53.520,1:45:57.040
the state and you get the action itself

1:45:55.199,1:45:58.560
now this will make a lot of sense later

1:45:57.040,1:46:00.719
but what we want to do is whenever we

1:45:58.560,1:46:02.880
just get that action inside of our state

1:46:00.719,1:46:04.360
we're going to say change the room id to

1:46:02.880,1:46:06.400
whatever the

1:46:04.360,1:46:08.560
action.payload.room id is

1:46:06.400,1:46:10.000
okay and this will make a lot of sense

1:46:08.560,1:46:12.320
once we go ahead and break this down and

1:46:10.000,1:46:13.760
again redux can be scary guys it can be

1:46:12.320,1:46:14.960
scary but don't freak out about it we're

1:46:13.760,1:46:17.040
going to break it down it'll make a lot

1:46:14.960,1:46:18.639
of sense okay abdul says i was the one

1:46:17.040,1:46:20.560
who did the 500 can i get a shout out

1:46:18.639,1:46:22.159
there you go i did right

1:46:20.560,1:46:23.600
so we need to export this so that way we

1:46:22.159,1:46:25.840
can use it outside so firstly we're

1:46:23.600,1:46:27.040
going to change counter to app slice

1:46:25.840,1:46:28.400
we're going to go here to get rid of

1:46:27.040,1:46:30.080
these and we're going to make it enter

1:46:28.400,1:46:33.119
room so now that we can use this enter

1:46:30.080,1:46:35.360
room outside of the

1:46:33.119,1:46:37.440
uh app slice component as in function

1:46:35.360,1:46:40.719
okay so these are called selectors now

1:46:37.440,1:46:42.400
so once we push a value into the global

1:46:40.719,1:46:44.400
store how do i basically remember i said

1:46:42.400,1:46:46.080
you dispatch an action which goes ahead

1:46:44.400,1:46:50.320
and changes a bit of the store how do i

1:46:46.080,1:46:51.840
now grab that bit of data the room id

1:46:50.320,1:46:53.760
from the global store right we have

1:46:51.840,1:46:55.440
something called a selector selectors

1:46:53.760,1:46:56.960
are really important you need to learn

1:46:55.440,1:46:58.960
them and this is how you write a

1:46:56.960,1:47:02.239
selector so we're going to say select

1:46:58.960,1:47:05.199
room id oops select room id so select

1:47:02.239,1:47:06.960
room id and this will have the state or

1:47:05.199,1:47:09.360
have access to the state it goes into

1:47:06.960,1:47:11.199
state dot app but i mean it's defined by

1:47:09.360,1:47:12.239
app because this is the app slice and

1:47:11.199,1:47:14.639
then here we're going to say

1:47:12.239,1:47:17.199
estate.app.room

1:47:14.639,1:47:19.119
id right perfect and we just got 20

1:47:17.199,1:47:21.520
likes insane stuff dude honestly crazy

1:47:19.119,1:47:22.719
crazy stuff right um so now what i'm

1:47:21.520,1:47:25.360
going to do

1:47:22.719,1:47:27.679
is go ahead and say export default

1:47:25.360,1:47:29.600
app slice there we go okay appstore

1:47:27.679,1:47:31.600
reducer now everything should be clean

1:47:29.600,1:47:33.520
here right so if we hit save and we go

1:47:31.600,1:47:34.800
back to our application and let's go

1:47:33.520,1:47:36.159
ahead and see no errors that's what we

1:47:34.800,1:47:38.000
want to see okay so i'm going to go

1:47:36.159,1:47:40.400
ahead and double check let's go to our

1:47:38.000,1:47:43.119
sidebar option now so

1:47:40.400,1:47:44.719
i've went ahead and i've i can push into

1:47:43.119,1:47:46.639
the database successfully but i want to

1:47:44.719,1:47:48.560
go ahead and remember when i click one

1:47:46.639,1:47:51.199
of these for example this one i need to

1:47:48.560,1:47:52.639
push that room id into

1:47:51.199,1:47:55.360
the

1:47:52.639,1:47:57.199
into the um one sec let me see uh yeah

1:47:55.360,1:47:59.040
i'm going to push that id into the redux

1:47:57.199,1:48:00.320
store now true youngs has a good

1:47:59.040,1:48:01.679
question so he says hi sonny love what

1:48:00.320,1:48:03.119
you're doing thank you dude i have one

1:48:01.679,1:48:05.760
question what's the difference between

1:48:03.119,1:48:07.520
using redux and the data layer they

1:48:05.760,1:48:10.000
approach used in the last

1:48:07.520,1:48:11.520
slack clone so big difference honestly

1:48:10.000,1:48:13.679
and what we're going to basically be

1:48:11.520,1:48:15.679
saying is firstly ellie no we will not

1:48:13.679,1:48:17.760
be using it but don't spam please

1:48:15.679,1:48:19.440
yes

1:48:17.760,1:48:21.520
between redux and daily so they are both

1:48:19.440,1:48:24.320
essentially global stores right but

1:48:21.520,1:48:26.320
redux is the sort of commercial level

1:48:24.320,1:48:27.679
solution to state management okay you

1:48:26.320,1:48:29.679
need to know redux if you're going to be

1:48:27.679,1:48:30.880
a react developer it's pretty much used

1:48:29.679,1:48:32.800
in a lot of the companies you're going

1:48:30.880,1:48:34.320
to find yourself working at so you do

1:48:32.800,1:48:37.360
need to have this on your cv and it's

1:48:34.320,1:48:39.520
going to be a hugely valuable skill to

1:48:37.360,1:48:41.840
have okay so definitely recommend you

1:48:39.520,1:48:42.800
pick this skill up right so at this

1:48:41.840,1:48:44.159
point we're going to go ahead and click

1:48:42.800,1:48:46.000
this and we want to dispatch it so that

1:48:44.159,1:48:48.000
when we click this it goes ahead and

1:48:46.000,1:48:49.440
fires off select channel because this

1:48:48.000,1:48:51.840
does not have the prop add channel

1:48:49.440,1:48:53.280
option okay so what i'm going to do now

1:48:51.840,1:48:55.280
is and i just answered that question

1:48:53.280,1:48:56.960
dude so

1:48:55.280,1:48:58.159
oh my god solution size thank you so

1:48:56.960,1:48:59.440
much for your videos i'm just 17 i

1:48:58.159,1:49:00.560
earned more than my parents do i'm

1:48:59.440,1:49:02.400
grateful to have you as my teacher

1:49:00.560,1:49:04.639
that's incredible guys honestly i think

1:49:02.400,1:49:05.840
we're going to break 600 likes in select

1:49:04.639,1:49:07.920
channel right now what i'm going to do

1:49:05.840,1:49:11.119
with the select channel is i'm going to

1:49:07.920,1:49:14.000
go ahead and do

1:49:11.119,1:49:15.840
i'm going to say okay if there is an id

1:49:14.000,1:49:18.159
all right so if we get an id posture as

1:49:15.840,1:49:19.840
a prop and the only one with ids right

1:49:18.159,1:49:20.960
now is the these ones because they're

1:49:19.840,1:49:23.360
the ones we mapped through from the

1:49:20.960,1:49:25.199
database these ones didn't have an id

1:49:23.360,1:49:27.520
and then what we're going to say is if

1:49:25.199,1:49:30.239
there's an id i want to dispatch an

1:49:27.520,1:49:31.920
action into that global store so firstly

1:49:30.239,1:49:33.280
we need like something that allows us to

1:49:31.920,1:49:35.119
dispatch

1:49:33.280,1:49:36.000
that action into the global store so we

1:49:35.119,1:49:37.920
use

1:49:36.000,1:49:39.920
we need to get the dispatch sort of i

1:49:37.920,1:49:41.520
call it like a dispatch gun it allows us

1:49:39.920,1:49:43.920
to shoot actions into the global store

1:49:41.520,1:49:45.520
okay so i say const dispatch equals use

1:49:43.920,1:49:48.239
dispatch which is a fantasy hook

1:49:45.520,1:49:49.840
provided by the react uh redux devtools

1:49:48.239,1:49:52.000
so let's go ahead and import that and

1:49:49.840,1:49:53.119
you see use dispatch from react redux

1:49:52.000,1:49:54.400
we pretty much do that now we've got

1:49:53.119,1:49:57.040
this little gun that we can shoot

1:49:54.400,1:49:59.520
actions into the store okay

1:49:57.040,1:50:01.599
so um there we go so now we're gonna do

1:49:59.520,1:50:03.760
is go ahead and say if id i'm gonna say

1:50:01.599,1:50:06.080
dispatch right and remember we created

1:50:03.760,1:50:08.480
an enter room function right so i'm

1:50:06.080,1:50:10.000
gonna type in enter room and i'm gonna

1:50:08.480,1:50:11.360
import it from our features right

1:50:10.000,1:50:13.199
remember this was the action that we

1:50:11.360,1:50:15.599
went ahead and done remember that took

1:50:13.199,1:50:17.840
something called a payload okay that

1:50:15.599,1:50:19.520
took a payload right uh ronit says i got

1:50:17.840,1:50:21.040
an internship on react looking for

1:50:19.520,1:50:22.320
you're helping up coin days do you join

1:50:21.040,1:50:24.560
zero to full stack hero the whole

1:50:22.320,1:50:26.320
community will help you and me right so

1:50:24.560,1:50:27.920
we're going to pass a payload here which

1:50:26.320,1:50:30.320
is we put the parentheses we put an

1:50:27.920,1:50:31.920
object and inside of here what i'm going

1:50:30.320,1:50:35.599
to say is i'm going to pass in the room

1:50:31.920,1:50:36.639
id and that's going to be the um

1:50:35.599,1:50:39.360
let's think about this going to be the

1:50:36.639,1:50:41.760
id right of the the component so the id

1:50:39.360,1:50:43.840
here now what's happening is when we

1:50:41.760,1:50:47.280
click this button it will push

1:50:43.840,1:50:49.760
that value of the room id or the channel

1:50:47.280,1:50:51.599
id into the global store and basically

1:50:49.760,1:50:52.719
think about what we're doing here that's

1:50:51.599,1:50:54.239
going to be the channel that we're

1:50:52.719,1:50:56.560
actively going to be inside of so if i

1:50:54.239,1:50:58.080
click this one it clicks the id for that

1:50:56.560,1:51:00.320
it pushes the id for this inside the

1:50:58.080,1:51:01.760
global store if i click coding it pushes

1:51:00.320,1:51:03.199
that into the global store right and

1:51:01.760,1:51:05.360
this is empty right now so if i say

1:51:03.199,1:51:07.360
hello see it's a fresh chat if i do papa

1:51:05.360,1:51:09.199
fam it'll go ahead switch out papa fam's

1:51:07.360,1:51:10.880
empty as well hashtag papa let's do

1:51:09.199,1:51:13.360
proper farm legends

1:51:10.880,1:51:15.360
let's do youtube and you see it's just

1:51:13.360,1:51:17.040
pushing different values for the rooms

1:51:15.360,1:51:19.360
into the global store and then we use

1:51:17.040,1:51:22.239
that value to go ahead and fetch the

1:51:19.360,1:51:24.000
messages inside the room all right so at

1:51:22.239,1:51:26.080
this point what we're going to do

1:51:24.000,1:51:27.840
is we're going to go ahead and vikram

1:51:26.080,1:51:28.719
wanted a quick look over the uh sidebar

1:51:27.840,1:51:31.679
container so i'm going to take a quick

1:51:28.719,1:51:31.679
water break where you see that

1:51:32.480,1:51:36.239
thank you shaker keep yourself hydrated

1:51:34.719,1:51:37.280
they actually do need reminders when i'm

1:51:36.239,1:51:39.599
live

1:51:37.280,1:51:41.520
right so what i'm going to do now is i'm

1:51:39.599,1:51:42.960
going to go ahead and say

1:51:41.520,1:51:45.440
on the slack channel so we actually went

1:51:42.960,1:51:46.880
ahead and added this in right so what

1:51:45.440,1:51:48.320
i'm going to show you is just to prove

1:51:46.880,1:51:50.560
that this works you can download the

1:51:48.320,1:51:51.920
redux dev tools and what's amazing about

1:51:50.560,1:51:54.400
the redox devtools if i go ahead and

1:51:51.920,1:51:56.480
open the inspector i pull down this

1:51:54.400,1:51:58.960
redux tab so you need to install redux

1:51:56.480,1:52:01.520
devtools on google chrome um and then

1:51:58.960,1:52:03.920
let's go ahead and click abc

1:52:01.520,1:52:06.159
right and right now oh nothing's

1:52:03.920,1:52:07.199
happening okay so let's see why let's go

1:52:06.159,1:52:09.199
ahead and do it again just because i

1:52:07.199,1:52:11.199
didn't refresh but if i click here it

1:52:09.199,1:52:13.679
dispatched an action now the action came

1:52:11.199,1:52:15.440
from the app slice right we dispatched

1:52:13.679,1:52:17.520
the enter room action

1:52:15.440,1:52:19.760
and now if i click on diff it shows me

1:52:17.520,1:52:21.119
how it modified the global store so you

1:52:19.760,1:52:22.800
can see it went into the app store it

1:52:21.119,1:52:25.360
went into the room and room was

1:52:22.800,1:52:28.159
initially know as the default value and

1:52:25.360,1:52:29.199
it changed it to the room id now if i go

1:52:28.159,1:52:30.639
ahead and see the action it was

1:52:29.199,1:52:32.800
dispatched this was the action that was

1:52:30.639,1:52:34.960
dispatched this was the payload of the

1:52:32.800,1:52:36.800
action and now if we check the overall

1:52:34.960,1:52:38.239
app store so imagine the global store

1:52:36.800,1:52:40.239
this is how we look at it inside the

1:52:38.239,1:52:41.920
state we can go ahead click inside and

1:52:40.239,1:52:45.040
we can see inside our app now we have

1:52:41.920,1:52:47.920
the room id it's currently selected this

1:52:45.040,1:52:50.639
is how it works inside of redox okay if

1:52:47.920,1:52:52.000
that if you can grasp that concept it

1:52:50.639,1:52:53.040
honestly doesn't get harder than that

1:52:52.000,1:52:55.040
when it comes to redux okay like

1:52:53.040,1:52:56.400
honestly that's the main grasp of it

1:52:55.040,1:52:57.520
everything else can kind of come from

1:52:56.400,1:53:00.239
that okay

1:52:57.520,1:53:01.679
so let's go ahead and continue on

1:53:00.239,1:53:02.960
now what we're gonna do that we have the

1:53:01.679,1:53:04.960
room id

1:53:02.960,1:53:06.400
we're gonna go ahead and uh let's just

1:53:04.960,1:53:08.320
firstly test if we can add a second

1:53:06.400,1:53:10.960
channel let's say papa fab

1:53:08.320,1:53:12.560
oops papa

1:53:10.960,1:53:14.320
and there you go you see now if i go

1:53:12.560,1:53:16.480
ahead and open this up

1:53:14.320,1:53:18.480
i can go into redux

1:53:16.480,1:53:19.760
and i can click on the different ones

1:53:18.480,1:53:21.280
and you see every time i click and

1:53:19.760,1:53:23.599
what's crazy guys is you can actually

1:53:21.280,1:53:24.400
rewind so that i can jump back to these

1:53:23.599,1:53:26.000
things

1:53:24.400,1:53:28.080
i can rewind and i can actually like

1:53:26.000,1:53:29.599
kind of like fast forward my application

1:53:28.080,1:53:30.960
which is insane

1:53:29.599,1:53:32.960
right you can see like every time i

1:53:30.960,1:53:34.320
click it it changes the room id

1:53:32.960,1:53:35.840
so you see how it's working under the

1:53:34.320,1:53:36.880
hood right now okay

1:53:35.840,1:53:39.840
all right so this is actually pretty

1:53:36.880,1:53:41.280
good so ankit says sonny can you please

1:53:39.840,1:53:42.719
use uh style components instead of

1:53:41.280,1:53:44.159
normal css and upcoming clones it gives

1:53:42.719,1:53:45.199
so much value in learning stuff yes dude

1:53:44.159,1:53:46.400
i would definitely make sure i

1:53:45.199,1:53:48.719
incorporate them

1:53:46.400,1:53:49.760
uh we're actually using it today right

1:53:48.719,1:53:51.440
so

1:53:49.760,1:53:53.360
okay so that's pretty cool now now we

1:53:51.440,1:53:56.080
have the ability to select the channel

1:53:53.360,1:53:57.920
so at this point we are done with the

1:53:56.080,1:54:00.320
sidebar right and we're literally six

1:53:57.920,1:54:02.080
likes away from five c 550 so whoever is

1:54:00.320,1:54:03.679
those six people you know what to do

1:54:02.080,1:54:05.360
right smash that like button let's get

1:54:03.679,1:54:06.560
that number up i swear to god i think we

1:54:05.360,1:54:08.880
can honestly keep climbing there's

1:54:06.560,1:54:10.239
nothing that's going to stop us today um

1:54:08.880,1:54:11.840
and what song should we have right now

1:54:10.239,1:54:14.320
let's go ahead and have something a

1:54:11.840,1:54:15.440
little bit upbeat

1:54:14.320,1:54:16.800
right

1:54:15.440,1:54:17.840
so

1:54:16.800,1:54:19.360
now what we're going to do is actually

1:54:17.840,1:54:20.960
have the chat section right because

1:54:19.360,1:54:22.480
we've already got the room id now so i

1:54:20.960,1:54:25.040
guess we can start actually implementing

1:54:22.480,1:54:26.880
the messages inside of the chat right

1:54:25.040,1:54:29.520
now the chat where is the chat defined

1:54:26.880,1:54:32.480
so we go into app.js you can see chat

1:54:29.520,1:54:35.920
was over here inside of the home route

1:54:32.480,1:54:37.520
okay so chat refers to this big section

1:54:35.920,1:54:40.000
over here right so we're going to go

1:54:37.520,1:54:41.520
ahead and build that out right now okay

1:54:40.000,1:54:44.080
so the first thing i'm going to do is

1:54:41.520,1:54:45.040
i'm going to go ahead and say

1:54:44.080,1:54:46.880
um

1:54:45.040,1:54:48.560
battle sword i have connected it

1:54:46.880,1:54:50.400
i've just done it in a new way right so

1:54:48.560,1:54:51.679
i'm going to create a chat component

1:54:50.400,1:54:54.800
and i'm going to go ahead and say in

1:54:51.679,1:54:58.000
components i'm going to say chat.js

1:54:54.800,1:54:59.520
i'm going to say rfce

1:54:58.000,1:55:01.040
and then here inside of here what i'm

1:54:59.520,1:55:02.480
going to do is chat container so i'm

1:55:01.040,1:55:03.760
going to go and say cons

1:55:02.480,1:55:05.040
chat

1:55:03.760,1:55:08.239
container

1:55:05.040,1:55:09.280
equals styled div

1:55:08.239,1:55:10.320
boom boom

1:55:09.280,1:55:11.360
and there you go and i'm going to go

1:55:10.320,1:55:14.000
ahead and

1:55:11.360,1:55:16.480
pull in styled from start components i

1:55:14.000,1:55:18.960
don't know why it's not popping up on my

1:55:16.480,1:55:20.480
auto sort of my import it was working

1:55:18.960,1:55:22.159
before but that's fine we gotta do it

1:55:20.480,1:55:23.760
manually that's fine

1:55:22.159,1:55:25.599
save okay now what i'm gonna do is say

1:55:23.760,1:55:28.080
this is a chat container

1:55:25.599,1:55:29.920
oops chat container there we go right

1:55:28.080,1:55:31.360
perfect so we have the chat container up

1:55:29.920,1:55:33.679
and running now i'm gonna go back into

1:55:31.360,1:55:35.760
my app.js and then make sure i've

1:55:33.679,1:55:38.320
imported this component in to our

1:55:35.760,1:55:40.639
application so there we go chat gets

1:55:38.320,1:55:41.599
popped in right there okay so at this

1:55:40.639,1:55:42.800
point to just double check that

1:55:41.599,1:55:44.880
everything's working i'm gonna open up

1:55:42.800,1:55:48.800
chat.js and i'm gonna go ahead and say

1:55:44.880,1:55:50.159
h1 i am the chat screen

1:55:48.800,1:55:52.880
save

1:55:50.159,1:55:54.480
and we should see it's not there right

1:55:52.880,1:55:56.400
now is actually there but we just need

1:55:54.480,1:55:58.400
to go ahead and get the color and things

1:55:56.400,1:56:00.480
like that set up correctly so the first

1:56:35.119,1:56:38.239
this point in time okay so i'll show you

1:56:36.400,1:56:40.639

1:56:40.639,1:56:44.639
so at this point the let's go ahead and

1:56:42.880,1:56:47.599
firstly do

1:56:44.639,1:56:48.960
inside of the chat screen right so

1:56:47.599,1:56:50.880
we have

1:56:48.960,1:56:53.679
the first thing we're going to do

1:56:50.880,1:56:55.119
is we have

1:56:53.679,1:56:57.440
the chat itself so the first thing i

1:56:55.119,1:56:59.440
need to actually do is pop a margin in

1:56:57.440,1:57:01.599
there so i can see it so if i do h1

1:56:59.440,1:57:03.760
let's just say hello okay and what i

1:57:01.599,1:57:06.159
need to do is i'm gonna see margin top

1:57:03.760,1:57:08.000
i should do ten let's just try and do 50

1:57:06.159,1:57:10.480
pixels we need to get that right so we

1:57:08.000,1:57:12.639
can see it there we go so 50 is about

1:57:10.480,1:57:15.599
right let's say 40 maybe

1:57:12.639,1:57:17.040
nope it's a uh 60.

1:57:15.599,1:57:19.599
there we go we'll try that one for now

1:57:17.040,1:57:20.880
okay so there we go we can see it okay

1:57:19.599,1:57:22.719
so at this point what i'm going to do is

1:57:20.880,1:57:26.239
i'm going to fetch the room information

1:57:22.719,1:57:28.239
okay so we firstly need to go ahead and

1:57:26.239,1:57:30.320
have the room details now what am i

1:57:28.239,1:57:32.880

show you in just a sec so

1:57:32.880,1:57:36.159
what i'm gonna firstly do is i'm gonna

1:57:34.719,1:57:37.599
go ahead and say

1:57:36.159,1:57:39.840
let's go ahead and create a header

1:57:37.599,1:57:42.320
section at the top okay so at the top of

1:57:39.840,1:57:43.599
this file we're gonna have a header okay

1:57:42.320,1:57:45.199
we're gonna have a header and i'm gonna

1:57:43.599,1:57:47.840
create this as a

1:57:45.199,1:57:49.280
styled component so here i'm gonna say

1:57:47.840,1:57:51.119
thank you so much jason sure i

1:57:49.280,1:57:53.440
appreciate it dude let's go ahead and

1:57:51.119,1:57:54.719
hit 600 likes guys come on we can do

1:57:53.440,1:57:56.800
this

1:57:54.719,1:57:59.360
style.div

1:57:56.800,1:58:00.960
right and then here what i'm going to do

1:57:59.360,1:58:03.760
is go ahead and do the following so i'm

1:58:00.960,1:58:05.599
going to say start div and then this is

1:58:03.760,1:58:08.159
going to be we'll start that in just a

1:58:05.599,1:58:10.639
sec inside of this header i'm going to

1:58:08.159,1:58:12.400
have a header left and a header right

1:58:10.639,1:58:13.599
and this will make a lot of sense just

1:58:12.400,1:58:16.880
bear with me okay so we've got the

1:58:13.599,1:58:18.880
header left and we've got a header right

1:58:16.880,1:58:21.679
right so header oops

1:58:18.880,1:58:23.440
i don't wait okay and now what i'm going

1:58:21.679,1:58:24.880
to do is go and create the styled

1:58:23.440,1:58:28.239
component versions of these i'm going to

1:58:24.880,1:58:30.400
say const at the left equals style.div

1:58:28.239,1:58:32.159
right like so we have authentication we

1:58:30.400,1:58:33.520
have everything inside this board coming

1:58:32.159,1:58:34.400
very soon okay

1:58:33.520,1:58:35.679
so

1:58:34.400,1:58:38.159
i'm gonna go ahead and copy this one and

1:58:35.679,1:58:40.000
we'll say header or right

1:58:38.159,1:58:41.679
and then we go save right there we go

1:58:40.000,1:58:43.280
looks good now what i'm gonna do is

1:58:41.679,1:58:44.960
we've got header left header right so

1:58:43.280,1:58:46.239
the header left is gonna have a h4

1:58:44.960,1:58:48.400
inside of it

1:58:46.239,1:58:52.159
all right so it's gonna have a h4

1:58:48.400,1:58:54.080
so this is gonna be a h4 oops h4

1:58:52.159,1:58:56.239
kite keeps opening up soon so annoying

1:58:54.080,1:58:57.520
right h4 and then here i'm gonna say

1:58:56.239,1:58:59.119
strong

1:58:57.520,1:59:01.199
i'm gonna have a strong bit of text

1:58:59.119,1:59:02.400
which is strong not string

1:59:01.199,1:59:04.320
yeah and then in here what i'm gonna

1:59:02.400,1:59:06.159
have is a hashtag and this will be the

1:59:04.320,1:59:07.760
room name okay so i'm gonna go ahead and

1:59:06.159,1:59:08.960
sort of fix this up with the room name

1:59:07.760,1:59:09.920
in a second i'll show you how we do that

1:59:08.960,1:59:11.119
in a sec

1:59:09.920,1:59:13.520
and then the next thing i'm gonna do is

1:59:11.119,1:59:14.719
actually have a little star icon okay

1:59:13.520,1:59:17.280
so i'm gonna say

1:59:14.719,1:59:18.639
boom star border outline okay

1:59:17.280,1:59:20.880
let's go ahead and say star border

1:59:18.639,1:59:21.840
outline

1:59:20.880,1:59:23.760
paste

1:59:21.840,1:59:25.840
what accent is this man this is a london

1:59:23.760,1:59:27.760
accent and then there you go you see it

1:59:25.840,1:59:29.520
says the room name okay so now i can get

1:59:27.760,1:59:30.880
rid of the h1 hello

1:59:29.520,1:59:33.119
and this top bit is gonna be the room

1:59:30.880,1:59:34.960
name okay so at this point we're gonna

1:59:33.119,1:59:36.480
go ahead and pop out the header right

1:59:34.960,1:59:38.400
section and then we'll go ahead and do

1:59:36.480,1:59:41.199
the fancy styling stuff to get this

1:59:38.400,1:59:43.119
finished okay so inside of header right

1:59:41.199,1:59:45.520
i simply want a p tag and i'm going to

1:59:43.119,1:59:47.040
have an info outline icon and it's going

1:59:45.520,1:59:48.719
to say details next to it so it

1:59:47.040,1:59:50.880
shouldn't say p

1:59:48.719,1:59:52.480
p there we go and it's going to say

1:59:50.880,1:59:54.400
something

1:59:52.480,1:59:56.639
details okay so it's going to have this

1:59:54.400,1:59:58.080
and it's going to say details and info

1:59:56.639,1:59:59.599
outlined i kind of show you what that is

1:59:58.080,2:00:01.040
in just a sec

1:59:59.599,2:00:03.840
i'm going to go ahead and pour this into

2:00:01.040,2:00:06.560
my code at the top there we go save

2:00:03.840,2:00:07.679
and if we refresh there you go

2:00:06.560,2:00:09.280
all right so that looks pretty good

2:00:07.679,2:00:10.880
pretty clean right now now i'm going to

2:00:09.280,2:00:12.480
go ahead and fix this up so it looks

2:00:10.880,2:00:15.760
very nice because right now i don't like

2:00:12.480,2:00:17.119
how it looks okay so here how do i get

2:00:15.760,2:00:19.360
this looking the way i need it i'm going

2:00:17.119,2:00:21.760
to say header equal style dot star dip

2:00:19.360,2:00:23.760
and say display flex firstly

2:00:21.760,2:00:25.040
right this one gets me hyped up man

2:00:23.760,2:00:26.960
let's go ahead and smash the like button

2:00:25.040,2:00:28.960
and get 600 guys come on

2:00:26.960,2:00:31.199
display flex

2:00:28.960,2:00:33.280
justify

2:00:31.199,2:00:35.760
content

2:00:33.280,2:00:37.440
space between

2:00:35.760,2:00:40.400
right and then i'm going to say padding

2:00:37.440,2:00:43.760
of 20 pixels or border bottom

2:00:40.400,2:00:43.760
boom i'm going to chuck that in here

2:00:43.840,2:00:48.239
all right save and now you guys can see

2:00:45.920,2:00:50.400
that immediately huge difference right

2:00:48.239,2:00:51.760
huge huge difference right right so now

2:00:50.400,2:00:53.360
what we're going to do these are

2:00:51.760,2:00:55.119
actually not these are not in inline

2:00:53.360,2:00:56.159
styles these are actually going to be uh

2:00:55.119,2:00:57.280
yeah

2:00:56.159,2:00:58.639
so at this point we're going to say

2:00:57.280,2:01:00.880
header left

2:00:58.639,2:01:02.560
um and the funny the funny thing i

2:01:00.880,2:01:04.719
always find is that every like sometimes

2:01:02.560,2:01:06.080
people actually demand things live i'm

2:01:04.719,2:01:08.320
like dude i don't think you realize how

2:01:06.080,2:01:09.920
much we're building in this live session

2:01:08.320,2:01:11.840
right so here what i'm going to say is

2:01:09.920,2:01:14.320
i'm going to target the h4 inside

2:01:11.840,2:01:16.400
because we have the little h4 at the top

2:01:14.320,2:01:19.199
and then what i'm going to do is say

2:01:16.400,2:01:21.040
display flex

2:01:19.199,2:01:23.679
right display flex and then here i'm

2:01:21.040,2:01:25.679
going to say text transform lowercase

2:01:23.679,2:01:27.679
right

2:01:25.679,2:01:29.520
save and there you can see it drops to a

2:01:27.679,2:01:32.080
lowercase and i'm going to then target

2:01:29.520,2:01:33.599
the h4 and the icon inside so similar to

2:01:32.080,2:01:35.280
the approach we've done before targeting

2:01:33.599,2:01:36.400
the material ui i can margin left in a

2:01:35.280,2:01:38.560
font size

2:01:36.400,2:01:41.520
let's go ahead and do that right now

2:01:38.560,2:01:43.840
there we go looks pretty good okay so

2:01:41.520,2:01:45.119
the next thing we can do at this point

2:01:43.840,2:01:47.199
is we're going to go ahead and i think

2:01:45.119,2:01:48.320
we should also maybe say display flex on

2:01:47.199,2:01:49.760
that

2:01:48.320,2:01:50.800
let's go ahead and do this oops that's a

2:01:49.760,2:01:52.480
horrible world let's go ahead and do

2:01:50.800,2:01:54.159
that fx and there you go you can see

2:01:52.480,2:01:55.840
that let's play flex and what i actually

2:01:54.159,2:01:57.360
want to do here is to say

2:01:55.840,2:01:59.520
um

2:01:57.360,2:02:01.840
let's go ahead and say the margin left

2:01:59.520,2:02:04.719
is there but i'm going to align items

2:02:01.840,2:02:07.360
align item center

2:02:04.719,2:02:09.520
and oops no what is that doing nope

2:02:07.360,2:02:11.679
you got line item center and there you

2:02:09.520,2:02:13.199
go right so it looks very nice we can

2:02:11.679,2:02:16.320
actually sort of push that slightly more

2:02:13.199,2:02:18.639
away with the 20 pixel push

2:02:16.320,2:02:20.400
and there we go okay so that's not

2:02:18.639,2:02:23.599
actually targeted that one correctly so

2:02:20.400,2:02:25.440
we need to go ahead and say the h4

2:02:23.599,2:02:29.199
in this case actually has it inside of

2:02:25.440,2:02:30.080
it so h4 h4 is going to have margin

2:02:29.199,2:02:31.679
right

2:02:30.080,2:02:34.159
margin right

2:02:31.679,2:02:36.639
of let's say 10 pixels

2:02:34.159,2:02:37.760
very slightly push it away there we go

2:02:36.639,2:02:39.440
and on the right hand side we're going

2:02:37.760,2:02:41.280
to go ahead and fix that

2:02:39.440,2:02:43.520
okay so on the right hand side i'm going

2:02:41.280,2:02:45.199
to go ahead and do styled is something

2:02:43.520,2:02:47.520
called felipe this is actually called

2:02:45.199,2:02:49.199
styled components so style components

2:02:47.520,2:02:50.800
are very popular and i'd recommend

2:02:49.199,2:02:52.239
jumping in learning out how they you

2:02:50.800,2:02:54.159
work and stuff like that very very

2:02:52.239,2:02:55.199
useful stuff now here i'm going to

2:02:54.159,2:02:57.920
target

2:02:55.199,2:03:00.159
the the p element inside

2:02:57.920,2:03:02.159
do display flex a line item centrally

2:03:00.159,2:03:04.239
one size of 14 pixels i'm going to

2:03:02.159,2:03:05.760
target the p tag and the material ui

2:03:04.239,2:03:07.040
icon inside of it

2:03:05.760,2:03:09.840
and i'm going to go ahead and say margin

2:03:07.040,2:03:11.920
right 5 pixels and there we go and this

2:03:09.840,2:03:14.000
is how it looks on slack right so it's a

2:03:11.920,2:03:15.840
very clean at this point in time looks

2:03:14.000,2:03:17.119
very very nice at this point okay that

2:03:15.840,2:03:19.520
looks pretty good i think that looks

2:03:17.119,2:03:21.599
pretty good okay joshua says your css

2:03:23.280,2:03:25.280
alright

2:03:24.159,2:03:26.400
so over at this point what we're going

2:03:25.280,2:03:28.560
to do is we're going to have the chat

2:03:26.400,2:03:30.480
over here okay so we've got the nice

2:03:28.560,2:03:32.400
header section complete okay so we've

2:03:30.480,2:03:34.480
got the header section complete the next

2:03:32.400,2:03:37.760
thing i want to do is actually go ahead

2:03:34.480,2:03:40.000
and add a sort of a sibling component to

2:03:37.760,2:03:41.840
the header now in order to do that in

2:03:40.000,2:03:43.360
react you're not allowed sort of two

2:03:41.840,2:03:45.599
components next to each other so if i

2:03:43.360,2:03:47.040
had something here for example it would

2:03:45.599,2:03:48.400
complain and say no no no you're not

2:03:47.040,2:03:51.040
allowed that so i'm going to have a

2:03:48.400,2:03:53.119
react fragment that wraps it

2:03:51.040,2:03:55.199
and then what i'll do is now i'm allowed

2:03:53.119,2:03:56.400
to have something next to the header all

2:03:55.199,2:03:58.239
right so what i'm going to do here is

2:03:56.400,2:04:00.159
actually have a

2:03:58.239,2:04:03.679
um a another

2:04:00.159,2:04:04.880
sort of a div called chat messages okay

2:04:03.679,2:04:06.560
so in this case we're going to just

2:04:04.880,2:04:08.239
create a uh

2:04:06.560,2:04:11.360
let's go ahead and do this to say

2:04:08.239,2:04:12.960
this is going to be chat messages

2:04:11.360,2:04:14.239
like this okay

2:04:12.960,2:04:17.679
and this one is going to be a style

2:04:14.239,2:04:20.719
component div so it's going to be const

2:04:17.679,2:04:22.159
equals styled div

2:04:20.719,2:04:23.440
there we go

2:04:22.159,2:04:24.400
and we can come to start that one

2:04:23.440,2:04:27.040
afterwards

2:04:24.400,2:04:28.480
all right so start div there we go and

2:04:27.040,2:04:30.400
inside of here what we're going to be

2:04:28.480,2:04:31.920
doing is we're going to be fetching all

2:04:30.400,2:04:34.079
the messages and this is where we would

2:04:31.920,2:04:35.520
sort of list out the messages

2:04:34.079,2:04:37.199
right so i'll show you how we're going

2:04:35.520,2:04:38.560
to do that in a sec

2:04:37.199,2:04:40.159
but in order to do that first we

2:04:38.560,2:04:42.400
actually need this little chat box where

2:04:40.159,2:04:45.119
we can actually send in messages okay

2:04:42.400,2:04:47.520
um deepak singh yes exactly it's about

2:04:45.119,2:04:49.679
typing yes boom you see it drops it over

2:04:47.520,2:04:52.159
there and that's the message right so

2:04:49.679,2:04:53.920
little message as well okay so what i'm

2:04:52.159,2:04:56.000
going to do is let's start the messages

2:04:53.920,2:04:58.400
so go back to our chat we need to create

2:04:56.000,2:04:59.760
a chat component here okay

2:04:58.400,2:05:00.960
so

2:04:59.760,2:05:02.480
there you go i'm going to make this a

2:05:00.960,2:05:03.679
drop smaller okay so i'm going to make

2:05:02.480,2:05:05.119
this like maybe a chance all right

2:05:03.679,2:05:07.280
that's pretty good all right so we have

2:05:05.119,2:05:09.199
the chat there so underneath all of this

2:05:07.280,2:05:10.560
okay so underneath the chat messages i'm

2:05:09.199,2:05:13.199
actually gonna have something called a

2:05:10.560,2:05:15.520
chat input right we actually have 570

2:05:13.199,2:05:17.679
likes guys come on let's keep going i

2:05:15.520,2:05:19.360
love it man honestly i can't i can't

2:05:17.679,2:05:20.960
believe it thank you so much guys we're

2:05:19.360,2:05:23.199
going to create a component called chat

2:05:20.960,2:05:24.320
input okay now chat input is going to be

2:05:23.199,2:05:25.679
our own little component we're going to

2:05:24.320,2:05:28.400
create and this is going to be

2:05:25.679,2:05:30.159
responsible for this magic okay and what

2:05:28.400,2:05:31.920
this needs is going to have a few

2:05:30.159,2:05:33.520
different things right so it's actually

2:05:31.920,2:05:35.119
going to have a channel name that we're

2:05:33.520,2:05:36.320
going to pass to it so we're going to

2:05:35.119,2:05:38.159
pass a prop which is going to be the

2:05:36.320,2:05:39.760
channel name and we'll sort of sort that

2:05:38.159,2:05:40.639
one out in a sec so we need the channel

2:05:39.760,2:05:42.960
name

2:05:40.639,2:05:44.639
and i need the channel id right now we

2:05:42.960,2:05:46.639
have the channel id this is just simply

2:05:44.639,2:05:48.560
going to be the room id now how do i get

2:05:46.639,2:05:50.639
the room id wait a sec we didn't have

2:05:48.560,2:05:53.440
the room id did we oh we did because we

2:05:50.639,2:05:55.760
pushed it inside the store now how do i

2:05:53.440,2:05:58.000
grab it from the store we use the

2:05:55.760,2:05:59.840
selector that i mentioned earlier

2:05:58.000,2:06:02.239
so if i want the room id i say const

2:05:59.840,2:06:04.000
room id and let's say equals use

2:06:02.239,2:06:06.320
selector this will allow me to pull a

2:06:04.000,2:06:08.159
value from the redux store okay so i

2:06:06.320,2:06:10.719
need to simply go ahead and import this

2:06:08.159,2:06:14.800
from our react redux and then what i do

2:06:10.719,2:06:16.800
is i get the select room id

2:06:14.800,2:06:18.480
selector that i wrote earlier and what

2:06:16.800,2:06:20.320
this does it allows me to pull the room

2:06:18.480,2:06:22.079
id from the store all right this will

2:06:20.320,2:06:23.840
mean i'm allowed to basically go ahead

2:06:22.079,2:06:25.119
and when i select the room you can go

2:06:23.840,2:06:26.480
ahead and do it bottle says you're doing

2:06:25.119,2:06:27.760
great sony thank you so much dude thank

2:06:26.480,2:06:30.560

2:06:27.760,2:06:32.079
now appreciate all of you honestly right

2:06:30.560,2:06:34.079
so what we're going to do at this point

2:06:32.079,2:06:35.760
is we have the chat input which we need

2:06:34.079,2:06:38.400
to create so i'm going to go into my

2:06:35.760,2:06:40.639
components create component called chat

2:06:38.400,2:06:42.320
input.js okay

2:06:40.639,2:06:44.400
rfce

2:06:42.320,2:06:46.000
wait for it to pop in boom

2:06:44.400,2:06:47.199
and at this point i'm gonna go ahead and

2:06:46.000,2:06:49.679
say

2:06:47.199,2:06:52.159
const uh chat

2:06:49.679,2:06:55.040
input container

2:06:52.159,2:06:56.800
equals styled div all right this is

2:06:55.040,2:06:58.639
gonna be my style div

2:06:56.800,2:07:00.079
and i need to import

2:06:58.639,2:07:01.440
star components but again it's being

2:07:00.079,2:07:02.960
weird with the auto wing port so i'm

2:07:01.440,2:07:04.880
going to go ahead and manually do it

2:07:02.960,2:07:06.560
there we go and that this one is going

2:07:04.880,2:07:07.840
to be responsible for there we go all

2:07:06.560,2:07:09.920
right so this is going to be my div that

2:07:07.840,2:07:11.199
surrounds my chat input now for the chat

2:07:09.920,2:07:13.040
input screen how do we go ahead and

2:07:11.199,2:07:14.400
build this one out okay so for the chat

2:07:13.040,2:07:15.840
input screen i'm going to have a few

2:07:14.400,2:07:18.800
things inside of it it's going to have a

2:07:15.840,2:07:21.040
form okay so it's going to have a form

2:07:18.800,2:07:21.040
right

2:07:21.679,2:07:24.960
right um is anyone else obsessed to

2:07:23.679,2:07:26.239
learn everything from start or not the

2:07:24.960,2:07:27.760
whole progression of arts concept

2:07:26.239,2:07:30.480
karthik we actually cover everything

2:07:27.760,2:07:32.079
inside um you can use react context api

2:07:30.480,2:07:33.679
if you want but redux is gonna be the

2:07:32.079,2:07:35.760
professional one to use right so we're

2:07:33.679,2:07:37.679
gonna have a form inside the form we're

2:07:35.760,2:07:39.040
gonna have an input field okay now this

2:07:37.679,2:07:41.440
input field it's just gonna be a normal

2:07:39.040,2:07:43.840
input phone let's go ahead and say input

2:07:41.440,2:07:45.119
there we go oh god damn it right input

2:07:43.840,2:07:46.719
there we go

2:07:45.119,2:07:48.560
and inputs are self from closing so we

2:07:46.719,2:07:50.320
don't have that now the input is going

2:07:48.560,2:07:51.520
to have a placeholder right the good

2:07:50.320,2:07:52.719
thing about this placeholder is going to

2:07:51.520,2:07:54.079
have backticks because we're going to

2:07:52.719,2:07:56.239
have string interpolation so we're going

2:07:54.079,2:07:58.480
to say message

2:07:56.239,2:08:00.560
oops found

2:07:58.480,2:08:02.960
and then remember we passed in a prop

2:08:00.560,2:08:04.320
okay so string interpolation here allows

2:08:02.960,2:08:06.239
us to have a javascript variable inside

2:08:04.320,2:08:07.760
of our string so remember the props come

2:08:06.239,2:08:10.639
through here now we passed in a prop

2:08:07.760,2:08:11.840
earlier we passed in the channel name

2:08:10.639,2:08:13.520
okay so at this point i can get the

2:08:11.840,2:08:14.639
channel name

2:08:13.520,2:08:16.880
but we didn't actually pass in that

2:08:14.639,2:08:19.440
value okay instead what we did we passed

2:08:16.880,2:08:21.840
in the uh room id i think it was the

2:08:19.440,2:08:23.760
channel id we passed in so channel id

2:08:21.840,2:08:25.440
okay we passed that one in

2:08:23.760,2:08:27.280
right so at this point this one let's

2:08:25.440,2:08:29.679
just go ahead and say message room right

2:08:27.280,2:08:31.679
so for the mean time until i figured

2:08:29.679,2:08:33.599
that out okay marty says doing a great

2:08:31.679,2:08:35.520
job it's a fire thank you so much dude

2:08:33.599,2:08:37.119
for the input there we have it right now

2:08:35.520,2:08:39.679
what i'm going to do

2:08:37.119,2:08:41.199
is for the

2:08:39.679,2:08:43.679
buttons i'm going to actually have a

2:08:41.199,2:08:45.280
button and this button

2:08:43.679,2:08:47.440
i'm going to go ahead and grab a

2:08:45.280,2:08:49.760
material ui button yes i'm going to use

2:08:47.440,2:08:52.239
a material ui button

2:08:49.760,2:08:55.040
depicting yes right so here we've got

2:08:52.239,2:08:56.560
the button and then i went the buttons

2:08:55.040,2:08:57.440
have the text inside so i'm going to say

2:08:56.560,2:08:58.960
send

2:08:57.440,2:09:00.320
a message and this button is actually

2:08:58.960,2:09:01.280
going to be hidden right so i'll show

2:09:00.320,2:09:02.960
you what with the trick that we're going

2:09:01.280,2:09:07.280
to do here so this button is actually

2:09:02.960,2:09:08.400
hidden right and it's got type submit

2:09:07.280,2:09:10.079
and there's a reason why we do this

2:09:08.400,2:09:11.119
because if you have a button inside of a

2:09:10.079,2:09:12.639
form

2:09:11.119,2:09:13.920
and you have type submit when you type

2:09:12.639,2:09:16.239
in your input field and you hit the

2:09:13.920,2:09:17.840
enter key it will submit the button

2:09:16.239,2:09:19.119
right which allows us to have that sort

2:09:17.840,2:09:20.880
of cool functionality without the

2:09:19.119,2:09:21.760
visibility of a button and when we click

2:09:20.880,2:09:23.360
this button we're going to have a

2:09:21.760,2:09:24.639
function click off which is called send

2:09:23.360,2:09:27.119
message

2:09:24.639,2:09:29.840
okay uh karthik now i'm full time

2:09:27.119,2:09:31.520
teaching so i i do zero to four stack

2:09:29.840,2:09:32.719
hero by the way so zero to full secure

2:09:31.520,2:09:35.280
is the community that i built with the

2:09:32.719,2:09:37.440
papa fam first link in the description

2:09:35.280,2:09:39.520
two days left for the huge sale and then

2:09:37.440,2:09:40.719
we pretty much close the doors i don't

2:09:39.520,2:09:43.040
know why we're opening them up again

2:09:40.719,2:09:44.960
okay so it's a huge sale right now and

2:09:43.040,2:09:46.639
uh you guys can go ahead and enjoy that

2:09:44.960,2:09:47.920
if you want okay

2:09:46.639,2:09:49.760
so

2:09:47.920,2:09:51.360
uh don't blame me if you said something

2:09:49.760,2:09:53.199
i didn't know it ended because i'm

2:09:51.360,2:09:55.040
telling you now it's ending right so

2:09:53.199,2:09:56.960
there's a send message when you have a

2:09:55.040,2:09:59.119
button event it has something called an

2:09:56.960,2:10:01.040
event here we say e dot prevent default

2:09:59.119,2:10:03.040
because default when we have a form when

2:10:01.040,2:10:04.560
we hit enter on it it will refresh the

2:10:03.040,2:10:06.320
page we don't want that okay so this

2:10:04.560,2:10:08.639
will prevent the refresh prevents the

2:10:06.320,2:10:09.760
refresh from occurring oh yeah prevent

2:10:08.639,2:10:11.440
refresh okay

2:10:09.760,2:10:13.119
there we go

2:10:11.440,2:10:14.800
uh

2:10:13.119,2:10:16.719
right

2:10:14.800,2:10:18.400
so naruto i will answer that when we get

2:10:16.719,2:10:20.320
to it don't worry dude so okay at this

2:10:18.400,2:10:21.119
point we've got the chat input

2:10:20.320,2:10:22.719
okay

2:10:21.119,2:10:23.920
so now what i'm going to do is it says

2:10:22.719,2:10:26.000
chatting but it's not defined let's go

2:10:23.920,2:10:27.840
back to our chat and let's go ahead and

2:10:26.000,2:10:29.840
import chat and

2:10:27.840,2:10:32.159
all right so now if we refresh

2:10:29.840,2:10:35.520
okay so we've got the message room send

2:10:32.159,2:10:35.520
okay got itchy yeah ouch

2:10:35.599,2:10:37.760
all right

2:10:36.400,2:10:39.360
headphones get uncomfortable sometimes

2:10:37.760,2:10:41.440
there we go all right

2:10:39.360,2:10:42.960
so we've got chat input so at this point

2:10:41.440,2:10:44.320
you can see if i hit this and i hit

2:10:42.960,2:10:46.960
enter it would actually trigger off the

2:10:44.320,2:10:48.079
send button okay so

2:10:46.960,2:10:49.920
uh so what i'm going to do is for the

2:10:48.079,2:10:51.440
chat input let's go ahead and sort of

2:10:49.920,2:10:53.440
style this one out

2:10:51.440,2:10:55.520
right so inside of here what i'm going

2:10:53.440,2:10:57.840
to do is i'm actually going to target

2:10:55.520,2:10:59.840
the go into my chat input here

2:10:57.840,2:11:00.800
and we've got the star div okay so first

2:10:59.840,2:11:02.800
thing i want to do is i'm going to say

2:11:00.800,2:11:03.760
border radius to 20 pixels okay so i

2:11:02.800,2:11:05.760
want it to be a nice little border

2:11:03.760,2:11:07.199
radius behind it let's go ahead and do

2:11:05.760,2:11:08.560
this save

2:11:07.199,2:11:10.079
oops

2:11:08.560,2:11:12.400
border rate is 20 pixels and this will

2:11:10.079,2:11:14.079
give it a slight rounded corner okay now

2:11:12.400,2:11:16.079
i'm going to target the form and i'm

2:11:14.079,2:11:17.360
going to give it a bunch of properties

2:11:16.079,2:11:20.079
i'm going to say position relative

2:11:17.360,2:11:21.199
display flex and justify content center

2:11:20.079,2:11:23.199
the next thing i'm going to do is i'm

2:11:21.199,2:11:25.360
going to target the input form inside of

2:11:23.199,2:11:26.719
the form by doing this so we're going

2:11:25.360,2:11:28.400
inside the form

2:11:26.719,2:11:30.000
inside the input

2:11:28.400,2:11:32.320
right and then what i'm going to do is

2:11:30.000,2:11:33.679
i'm going to say position fixed bottom

2:11:32.320,2:11:36.159
30 pixels

2:11:33.679,2:11:38.560
width of 60 border 1 pixel border radius

2:11:36.159,2:11:40.480
3 pixels having a 20 and an outline of

2:11:38.560,2:11:43.440
none all of this will give us a nice

2:11:40.480,2:11:44.719
look and feel to this okay boom save

2:11:43.440,2:11:45.840
and if i go ahead and see that you see

2:11:44.719,2:11:47.920
that guys look at that it drops to the

2:11:45.840,2:11:49.360
bottom now this button is randomly over

2:11:47.920,2:11:50.560
here right but this is actually going to

2:11:49.360,2:11:52.239
be sort of you know

2:11:50.560,2:11:53.679
relative to where the screen moves right

2:11:52.239,2:11:56.239
because it's position fixed and it's

2:11:53.679,2:11:58.639
bottom 30 pixels off the ground and the

2:11:56.239,2:12:00.079
width is 60 pixels hence why it's 60

2:11:58.639,2:12:02.000
pixels this way

2:12:00.079,2:12:03.280
now what i want to do is i want to hide

2:12:02.000,2:12:05.920
that button so i'm going to target the

2:12:03.280,2:12:07.280
form target the button and say display

2:12:05.920,2:12:09.040
none and i'm going to make it important

2:12:07.280,2:12:10.480
so that way it just hides right because

2:12:09.040,2:12:12.880
it's material ui buttons sometimes you

2:12:10.480,2:12:14.960
have to override the styles save

2:12:12.880,2:12:16.880
and boom it disappears right now we just

2:12:14.960,2:12:19.679
get this nice functionality but if i

2:12:16.880,2:12:21.920
type in and i hit enter it will trigger

2:12:19.679,2:12:23.599
off my send message function

2:12:21.920,2:12:26.159
right if i get rid of this line the

2:12:23.599,2:12:28.560
prevent default one look what happens

2:12:26.159,2:12:30.880
if i hit enter see how it refreshed we

2:12:28.560,2:12:32.320
don't want a refresh right refreshing is

2:12:30.880,2:12:33.360
not our friend so that's why we don't

2:12:32.320,2:12:36.400
want it okay

2:12:33.360,2:12:38.960
so guys let's keep the energy up right

2:12:36.400,2:12:40.079
because if now we're about to hit 600

2:12:38.960,2:12:40.960
let's go

2:12:40.079,2:12:42.560
all right i'm going to go ahead and

2:12:40.960,2:12:43.760
change this one the rule says your

2:12:42.560,2:12:44.800
tutorials are giving me the confidence

2:12:43.760,2:12:46.800
to go out and apply for software

2:12:44.800,2:12:48.480
development jobs do it dude you got this

2:12:46.800,2:12:50.159
man and the papa fam's got your back

2:12:48.480,2:12:52.320
this is why i say to everyone join

2:12:50.159,2:12:54.079
honestly join join join this this is the

2:12:52.320,2:12:56.079
best community ever

2:12:54.079,2:12:57.040
right so at this point we have this

2:12:56.079,2:12:59.199
right now i'm going to go ahead and

2:12:57.040,2:13:00.880
upgrade this so we can fetch this

2:12:59.199,2:13:02.320
information okay so how do i go ahead

2:13:00.880,2:13:04.159
and do this now this is looking pretty

2:13:02.320,2:13:05.679
good at this point now i'm gonna firstly

2:13:04.159,2:13:07.360
add a message in and then we'll carry on

2:13:05.679,2:13:09.119
okay so

2:13:07.360,2:13:11.040
i'm gonna go into my

2:13:09.119,2:13:12.159
chat input

2:13:11.040,2:13:13.840
all right now let's go ahead and

2:13:12.159,2:13:15.360
implement the send message functionality

2:13:13.840,2:13:16.800
okay so the first thing i want to do is

2:13:15.360,2:13:18.320
i want to protect against any kind of

2:13:16.800,2:13:20.079
bug right now i'm going to say if there

2:13:18.320,2:13:22.320
is no channel id

2:13:20.079,2:13:23.360
right then i just want to return i'm

2:13:22.320,2:13:24.960
going to return first because i just

2:13:23.360,2:13:26.159
want to exit this this function i don't

2:13:24.960,2:13:28.159
want to do anything if there's no

2:13:26.159,2:13:30.480
channel id present okay the next thing

2:13:28.159,2:13:32.320
i'll do is i want to access my db okay

2:13:30.480,2:13:33.679
now the first thing before i carry on

2:13:32.320,2:13:35.280
actually is i've imported the db because

2:13:33.679,2:13:37.360
i'm going to need it i need to get the

2:13:35.280,2:13:39.599
piece of text from this input filled

2:13:37.360,2:13:40.639
okay so how do i do that i'm going to

2:13:39.599,2:13:42.000
show you a different way of doing it

2:13:40.639,2:13:43.520
this time when i say const let me show

2:13:42.000,2:13:45.119
you use refs i'm going to say input

2:13:43.520,2:13:47.119
reference

2:13:45.119,2:13:48.880
equals use ref so typically you've seen

2:13:47.119,2:13:50.800
me do it in a way where we map it to a

2:13:48.880,2:13:52.480
piece of state but this is another way

2:13:50.800,2:13:54.960
of doing it okay so we can go ahead and

2:13:52.480,2:13:56.400
import user f from a react and the way

2:13:54.960,2:13:58.000
we do is we save

2:13:56.400,2:13:59.119
and then here we go with another banger

2:13:58.000,2:14:01.040
let's go guys that's what i'm talking

2:13:59.119,2:14:02.560
about yeah and now what we do is we go

2:14:01.040,2:14:04.079
ahead and map this to this we say

2:14:02.560,2:14:06.159
reference to the input field is input

2:14:04.079,2:14:07.360
ref and you see it's just a lot cleaner

2:14:06.159,2:14:08.880
right it's a lot cleaner when we do it

2:14:07.360,2:14:10.159
this way and now what i'm going to say

2:14:08.880,2:14:11.599
is i'm going to go into the db dot

2:14:10.159,2:14:14.079
collection

2:14:11.599,2:14:14.800
okay i'm gonna go into the rooms

2:14:14.079,2:14:17.280
okay

2:14:14.800,2:14:19.360
and i'm gonna get the channel by going

2:14:17.280,2:14:21.280
into the document with the channel id so

2:14:19.360,2:14:23.760
think about what we're doing here

2:14:21.280,2:14:26.960
is we're literally going through

2:14:23.760,2:14:26.960
right well up and there

2:14:33.119,2:14:37.920
we're going into the the room itself the

2:14:35.280,2:14:40.079
document and then we're going into the

2:14:37.920,2:14:42.239
collection of messages okay so we're

2:14:40.079,2:14:44.159
going into the collection

2:14:42.239,2:14:45.360
of messages

2:14:44.159,2:14:46.560
and all i'm going to do is i'm going to

2:14:45.360,2:14:48.159
add a message in there because i'm

2:14:46.560,2:14:50.560
literally writing it in

2:14:48.159,2:14:52.239
right and then to do that what we do is

2:14:50.560,2:14:53.920
we simply go ahead

2:14:52.239,2:14:56.400
and we say okay the message i want to

2:14:53.920,2:14:58.480
add is message and the contents of that

2:14:56.400,2:15:00.079
message is i want to grab it from the

2:14:58.480,2:15:02.159
input field okay so how do i grab it

2:15:00.079,2:15:03.199
from this input field we basically say

2:15:02.159,2:15:05.440
okay

2:15:03.199,2:15:07.119
get the input reference get the current

2:15:05.440,2:15:08.480
thing it's pointing to

2:15:07.119,2:15:10.159
right and i'm basically going to go

2:15:08.480,2:15:11.760
ahead and get the value of it pretty

2:15:10.159,2:15:14.639
much that's it right that's how we do it

2:15:11.760,2:15:16.000
we get the value of the input filled at

2:15:14.639,2:15:17.760
that point okay

2:15:16.000,2:15:20.000
next thing we did shri khan thank you so

2:15:17.760,2:15:22.639
much dude shri khan's vengala for a

2:15:20.000,2:15:24.480
lovely five dollar donation appreciate

2:15:22.639,2:15:25.360
you dude thank you so much

2:15:24.480,2:15:27.040
right

2:15:25.360,2:15:28.719
now at this point we've got the message

2:15:27.040,2:15:30.239
now i need a timestamp just think about

2:15:28.719,2:15:32.320
it this way if i send a message in

2:15:30.239,2:15:34.960
london and you're based in new york or

2:15:32.320,2:15:36.480
asia or wherever it is my timestamp is

2:15:34.960,2:15:40.000
different to your timestamp so if we

2:15:36.480,2:15:41.840
both use firebase's firestores timestamp

2:15:40.000,2:15:44.159
then it's going to be the same so we can

2:15:41.840,2:15:46.159
sort our messages accordingly so how do

2:15:44.159,2:15:48.639
we do that right but firstly i need to

2:15:46.159,2:15:51.199
go ahead and import firebase

2:15:48.639,2:15:52.560
the actual firebase okay

2:15:51.199,2:15:54.960
and then what i need to do is go ahead

2:15:52.560,2:15:56.880
and say timestamp

2:15:54.960,2:15:59.920
all right timestamp and what i do is i

2:15:56.880,2:16:02.840
say at this point firebase dot

2:15:59.920,2:16:05.440
firestore guys almost to 600 likes let's

2:16:02.840,2:16:06.880
go why am i firebased on fire so i just

2:16:05.440,2:16:09.679
saw it and i was like oh my god that's

2:16:06.880,2:16:12.719
creeping we go to the field value and

2:16:09.679,2:16:14.000
then we say get the server timestamp

2:16:12.719,2:16:15.520
and then that's a function basically

2:16:14.000,2:16:17.679
that will give us the server timestamps

2:16:15.520,2:16:21.360
now all of our timestamps are the same

2:16:17.679,2:16:23.440
boom there we go 600 likes wow

2:16:21.360,2:16:24.560
like just wow man

2:16:23.440,2:16:26.079
a channel

2:16:24.560,2:16:28.000
we're getting like the same number of

2:16:26.079,2:16:30.960
likes as channels uh you know hundreds

2:16:28.000,2:16:32.319
of thousands of subs like

2:16:30.960,2:16:33.359
guys when we get to a hundred thousand

2:16:32.319,2:16:35.519
subs

2:16:33.359,2:16:38.719
oh ho the world better watch yourself

2:16:35.519,2:16:40.960
proper fans coming coming fast guys 20

2:16:38.719,2:16:42.639
likes just flew in like that

2:16:40.960,2:16:44.319
god damn this is what i'm talking about

2:16:42.639,2:16:46.719
guys

2:16:44.319,2:16:48.319
let's go all right so the next thing i

2:16:46.719,2:16:51.040
want to do is when i send a message in i

2:16:48.319,2:16:52.880
want to clear the text okay so the final

2:16:51.040,2:16:54.399
thing i want to do is go ahead and say

2:16:52.880,2:16:56.000
input ref

2:16:54.399,2:16:57.519
dot current

2:16:56.000,2:16:58.559
dot

2:16:57.519,2:17:00.319
value

2:16:58.559,2:17:02.479
actually what we can do at this point is

2:17:00.319,2:17:04.399
we can say

2:17:02.479,2:17:06.719
okay so you can do it this way right you

2:17:04.399,2:17:08.639
can do it this way or you can do it a

2:17:06.719,2:17:10.160
way of uh i've forgotten how you

2:17:08.639,2:17:11.920
actually clear it now deepak thank you

2:17:10.160,2:17:13.519
so much man so we can do it this way

2:17:11.920,2:17:15.120
this was a way of showing you i'm going

2:17:13.519,2:17:17.120
to show you right now the previous way

2:17:15.120,2:17:18.479
we're going to say equals value equals

2:17:17.120,2:17:20.309
input

2:17:18.479,2:17:22.160
and let's go and say input

2:17:20.309,2:17:23.679
[Music]

2:17:22.160,2:17:25.200
and this is how we initialize state

2:17:23.679,2:17:26.960
which is basically how we write a

2:17:25.200,2:17:28.240
variable inside of react

2:17:26.960,2:17:31.840
by default the input is going to be

2:17:28.240,2:17:31.840
blank and we say set input

2:17:32.639,2:17:35.920
all right

2:17:33.840,2:17:37.439
thank you so much dude for supporting

2:17:35.920,2:17:39.840
and then here what we say is instead of

2:17:37.439,2:17:41.840
this we go ahead and say input and what

2:17:39.840,2:17:44.080
we do is whenever we type in the input

2:17:41.840,2:17:47.040
field we say on change

2:17:44.080,2:17:49.040
[Music]

2:17:47.040,2:17:50.479
on change equals and this will give us e

2:17:49.040,2:17:52.840
and we say okay whenever the user types

2:17:50.479,2:17:55.679
in i'm going to set the input to a

2:17:52.840,2:17:59.280
e.target.value e.target

2:17:55.679,2:18:01.760
value oops oh e dot target dot value

2:17:59.280,2:18:02.960
like so save and what this will do is it

2:18:01.760,2:18:04.240
will means it means that we need to

2:18:02.960,2:18:05.519
import this

2:18:04.240,2:18:07.519
but that was just showing you an example

2:18:05.519,2:18:09.359
of how you can use references as well

2:18:07.519,2:18:10.719
i legally says you're doing a great

2:18:09.359,2:18:11.840
service i've been a react developer for

2:18:10.719,2:18:13.359

2:19:04.960,2:19:08.240
like you know you guys know what i'm

2:19:06.559,2:19:10.080
talking about when you get fake pngs

2:19:08.240,2:19:11.840
there we go i've got a jpeg there we go

2:19:10.080,2:19:13.120
all right so i've got a jpeg here it

2:19:11.840,2:19:15.679
doesn't matter you can use any picture

2:19:13.120,2:19:17.439
at this point okay so i've just popped

2:19:15.679,2:19:19.040
in a picture here

2:19:17.439,2:19:20.559
i'm gonna go ahead and come so now we've

2:19:19.040,2:19:21.519
got the user image okay so what i'm

2:19:20.559,2:19:22.880
going to do is i'm going to eventually

2:19:21.519,2:19:24.960
have it so when we log in it will pull

2:19:22.880,2:19:26.080
in that information right

2:19:24.960,2:19:28.639
um

2:19:26.080,2:19:30.319
okay so you can do ref or you can do the

2:19:28.639,2:19:32.160
other way guys it's completely fine

2:19:30.319,2:19:34.880
right um

2:19:32.160,2:19:36.160
there we go so and there are reasons for

2:19:34.880,2:19:38.080
each and all right but we're looking

2:19:36.160,2:19:40.399
against that right now okay so now at

2:19:38.080,2:19:42.880
this point what i'm going to do is have

2:19:40.399,2:19:45.200
it so that when i refresh right let's go

2:19:42.880,2:19:46.399
ahead and refresh and let's see now what

2:19:45.200,2:19:48.240
this will do is if we want to do is

2:19:46.399,2:19:49.760
we're going to say after we send that

2:19:48.240,2:19:52.080
message we're going to set the input to

2:19:49.760,2:19:53.600
empty okay done

2:19:52.080,2:19:55.359
so the input empty so now if i go ahead

2:19:53.600,2:19:57.920
and try this out save

2:19:55.359,2:19:59.439
and refresh okay let's get our firebase

2:19:57.920,2:20:02.560
up and running okay so we're in let's

2:19:59.439,2:20:04.720
say we go into the papa fan room and i'm

2:20:02.560,2:20:07.520
inside the public family and say abc

2:20:04.720,2:20:09.920
enter right oh did something happen did

2:20:07.520,2:20:11.600
it break what happened oh my god okay

2:20:09.920,2:20:13.680
let's have a look

2:20:11.600,2:20:16.080
so we're inside here

2:20:13.680,2:20:17.920
and nothing actually kicked off okay so

2:20:16.080,2:20:19.280
nothing kicked off let's go ahead and

2:20:17.920,2:20:22.240
see why

2:20:19.280,2:20:23.359
okay so i went into message input there

2:20:22.240,2:20:25.600
we go

2:20:23.359,2:20:28.000
unchanged value is input set input

2:20:25.600,2:20:32.080
target value message time sunny user

2:20:28.000,2:20:33.840
image there we go and refresh

2:20:32.080,2:20:35.120
okay let's go ahead and refresh and

2:20:33.840,2:20:36.960
let's say let me just double check my

2:20:35.120,2:20:37.840
terminal okay we're good and here i'm

2:20:36.960,2:20:39.200
going to say

2:20:37.840,2:20:41.040
abc

2:20:39.200,2:20:42.880
okay so right now something's actually

2:20:41.040,2:20:44.800
freaking out at this point uh there we

2:20:42.880,2:20:46.319
go cannot be called with an empty path

2:20:44.800,2:20:48.399
okay because the channel id there we go

2:20:46.319,2:20:50.800
it makes a lot of sense so

2:20:48.399,2:20:52.640
we need the channel id okay that needs

2:20:50.800,2:20:55.120
to be passed in so remember chat okay we

2:20:52.640,2:20:57.120
got the room id over here use selector

2:20:55.120,2:20:58.399
select room id so at this point what i

2:20:57.120,2:20:59.680
can do is i can actually just double

2:20:58.399,2:21:04.160
check that it gets passed through so i

2:20:59.680,2:21:05.520
can say console.log the channel id

2:21:04.160,2:21:09.359
right and then i'm going to go ahead and

2:21:05.520,2:21:10.720
refresh and i'm going to go and do f12

2:21:09.359,2:21:12.479
and then you can see the channel id is

2:21:10.720,2:21:14.640
no right now okay interesting if i click

2:21:12.479,2:21:17.040
this one now i've got a channel id

2:21:14.640,2:21:18.160
okay so with the channel id set what i'm

2:21:17.040,2:21:19.520
going to do is i'm going to type into

2:21:18.160,2:21:20.319
say test

2:21:19.520,2:21:21.920
okay

2:21:20.319,2:21:24.319
and i hit enter

2:21:21.920,2:21:26.399
right so i hit enter and nothing

2:21:24.319,2:21:28.240
actually happened okay which is very

2:21:26.399,2:21:29.520
very strange so let's go ahead and see

2:21:28.240,2:21:31.200
why because the channel already got

2:21:29.520,2:21:32.160
passed in here perfect okay let's go

2:21:31.200,2:21:34.160
over here

2:21:32.160,2:21:35.760
and what we've done over here actually

2:21:34.160,2:21:37.520
is we've said channel id is room id

2:21:35.760,2:21:39.359
perfect

2:21:37.520,2:21:42.800
okay

2:21:39.359,2:21:42.800
and let's refresh

2:21:46.880,2:21:50.479
all right

2:21:48.640,2:21:51.840
okay interesting let's have a look why

2:21:50.479,2:21:54.000
this is happening

2:21:51.840,2:21:56.800
document or collection rooms doc channel

2:21:54.000,2:21:58.160
id collection messages add

2:21:56.800,2:21:59.680
okay

2:21:58.160,2:22:01.600
here we go channel id

2:21:59.680,2:22:04.080
and we do have the channel id correct at

2:22:01.600,2:22:06.240
this point we're going into the room

2:22:04.080,2:22:07.520
and we should be adding into the message

2:22:06.240,2:22:09.200
is the input

2:22:07.520,2:22:11.680
timestamp is this timestamp the user is

2:22:09.200,2:22:13.760
sony sanger and the user image is this

2:22:11.680,2:22:15.280
okay

2:22:13.760,2:22:17.600
and what you need to do sometimes is

2:22:15.280,2:22:19.200
just cut the

2:22:17.600,2:22:20.319
this is a yarn start again okay let's do

2:22:19.200,2:22:21.920
this again

2:22:20.319,2:22:23.520
i do see the chat guys but i'm going to

2:22:21.920,2:22:26.399
block you if you keep asking me to speak

2:22:23.520,2:22:28.560
indie i'm not a pet okay let's carry on

2:22:26.399,2:22:29.520
all right

2:22:28.560,2:22:31.280
all right let's go ahead and wait for

2:22:29.520,2:22:33.439
that to restart so now what i'm going to

2:22:31.280,2:22:33.439
do

2:22:34.479,2:22:37.920
you can change the title in the

2:22:36.000,2:22:38.880
index.html if you do want to yes you can

2:22:37.920,2:22:40.240
do that

2:22:38.880,2:22:41.520
so now at this point if i go ahead and

2:22:40.240,2:22:43.200
say testing although we need to make

2:22:41.520,2:22:46.479
sure we click a pop-up fam so this goes

2:22:43.200,2:22:49.280
and we click paper fam i type in testing

2:22:46.479,2:22:51.040
enter okay so this is interesting at

2:22:49.280,2:22:53.280
this point right so if there's no

2:22:51.040,2:22:54.960
channel id it's returning first so let's

2:22:53.280,2:22:56.479
go ahead and double check at this point

2:22:54.960,2:22:57.680
when we hit send message if there is a

2:22:56.479,2:23:00.000
channel id

2:22:57.680,2:23:00.000
right

2:23:00.720,2:23:04.560
so

2:23:02.240,2:23:06.479
let's go ahead here and then let's go

2:23:04.560,2:23:08.080
ahead and say abc

2:23:06.479,2:23:09.680
enter oh there we go that's what i was

2:23:08.080,2:23:12.000
looking for and i'll be called with an

2:23:09.680,2:23:13.920
empty path okay so that's because i

2:23:12.000,2:23:16.240
actually went ahead and didn't click the

2:23:13.920,2:23:18.399
uh correct channel so papa fam

2:23:16.240,2:23:20.240
there we go and if i type in test and i

2:23:18.399,2:23:22.640
hit enter okay

2:23:20.240,2:23:24.160
so you see guys it did reach there but i

2:23:22.640,2:23:26.479
wonder at this point if it's actually oh

2:23:24.160,2:23:29.040
if it's not damn it guys if it's not

2:23:26.479,2:23:31.920
channel id there we go ah

2:23:29.040,2:23:33.680
i missed it good spot guys good start

2:23:31.920,2:23:36.160
there we go that's how you know i need a

2:23:33.680,2:23:36.160
water break

2:23:37.040,2:23:41.520
smash the thumbs up button for everyone

2:23:38.560,2:23:43.200
who got that right well done guys

2:23:41.520,2:23:44.880
okay now that's exactly what the problem

2:23:43.200,2:23:46.399
was

2:23:44.880,2:23:48.080
right so we're gonna click on paper fam

2:23:46.399,2:23:49.760
type in testing

2:23:48.080,2:23:52.240
boom and you see it disappeared perfect

2:23:49.760,2:23:54.399
okay so now at this point we're gonna go

2:23:52.240,2:23:57.280
ahead and check if we entered in as you

2:23:54.399,2:23:58.720
can see we should have in here

2:23:57.280,2:24:00.720
let's go ahead and see

2:23:58.720,2:24:04.479
let's refresh oh there we go it came

2:24:00.720,2:24:06.080
through uh it was a bit of a second but

2:24:04.479,2:24:08.240
let's go ahead and carry on that was

2:24:06.080,2:24:10.240
water dylan yes that was water

2:24:08.240,2:24:12.560
everyone thinks it's vodka

2:24:10.240,2:24:14.720
but let's go ahead in the top one we say

2:24:12.560,2:24:16.479
on messages alright so now you can see

2:24:14.720,2:24:18.399
the message has been successfully

2:24:16.479,2:24:20.399
entered into the room okay so that's

2:24:18.399,2:24:21.520
exactly what i was looking for so now we

2:24:20.399,2:24:24.160
have the collection here message

2:24:21.520,2:24:26.399
timestamp user and user image okay so

2:24:24.160,2:24:27.680

2:24:26.399,2:24:29.040
channel name we need to go ahead and

2:24:27.680,2:24:31.359
pass in so how do we get the channel

2:24:29.040,2:24:33.439
name and all that good stuff set up okay

2:24:31.359,2:24:34.720
so inside of chat right now let's go

2:24:33.439,2:24:36.960
ahead and fetch the information that we

2:24:34.720,2:24:38.240
need okay so

2:24:36.960,2:24:40.319
first thing i want to do is get the room

2:24:38.240,2:24:43.359

2:24:43.359,2:24:47.280
actually really nicely all right so

2:24:44.880,2:24:48.960
using the new used collection i'll show

2:24:47.280,2:24:51.200

2:24:48.960,2:24:53.040
right so here import use collection from

2:24:51.200,2:24:54.000

2:25:03.600,2:25:09.359
i'm going to say okay

2:25:05.359,2:25:11.200
oops if there is a room id present right

2:25:09.359,2:25:13.200
then i'm going to query the firebase

2:25:11.200,2:25:17.160
database i'm going to say db i need to

2:25:13.200,2:25:17.160
import db and say db.collection

2:25:17.760,2:25:22.479
uh yes deepak using pusher

2:25:20.240,2:25:25.920
right so db.collection i'm going to say

2:25:22.479,2:25:27.439
go into rooms and get the document with

2:25:25.920,2:25:29.040
the room id

2:25:27.439,2:25:30.160
okay so this will be the room details

2:25:29.040,2:25:32.240
all right this will go ahead and get us

2:25:30.160,2:25:34.319
that information okay so that's how we

2:25:32.240,2:25:36.399
do that in this case and then for the

2:25:34.319,2:25:37.280
room messages i'm gonna do is a similar

2:25:36.399,2:25:38.479
thing

2:25:37.280,2:25:39.840
um

2:25:38.479,2:25:42.080
i think it's my i might actually use

2:25:39.840,2:25:44.000
collection might be um let me check that

2:25:42.080,2:25:46.160
in a sec actually but yeah we're gonna

2:25:44.000,2:25:48.160
do this one and then what i'm gonna do

2:25:46.160,2:25:50.800
is i think it's use document instead use

2:25:48.160,2:25:50.800
a document

2:25:51.520,2:25:55.920
here we go use document yeah and this

2:25:53.439,2:25:58.240
one will be doc room id perfect and then

2:25:55.920,2:26:00.720
what i'm going to say is const i'm going

2:25:58.240,2:26:02.640
to get the room messages as well

2:26:00.720,2:26:04.560
and this equals use collection you see

2:26:02.640,2:26:05.520
how easy this is guys like this is crazy

2:26:04.560,2:26:07.840
man

2:26:05.520,2:26:09.680
like it's so much easier doing than the

2:26:07.840,2:26:11.280
traditional way that you're doing it

2:26:09.680,2:26:13.200
right you say okay only if there's a

2:26:11.280,2:26:15.200
room id

2:26:13.200,2:26:17.280
then i'm chill should i give you a super

2:26:15.200,2:26:20.319
chat oh [ __ ] dude all right it's up to

2:26:17.280,2:26:23.520
you man it's a db dot collection

2:26:20.319,2:26:26.640
and then i'll say rooms

2:26:23.520,2:26:28.160
dot doc and we'll say room id

2:26:26.640,2:26:29.680
dot collection

2:26:28.160,2:26:32.160
of messages so i'm going to go into the

2:26:29.680,2:26:32.160
messages

2:26:32.479,2:26:37.200
oops messages

2:26:35.200,2:26:39.359
and then what i'm going to do is i'm

2:26:37.200,2:26:41.439
going to go ahead and say

2:26:39.359,2:26:43.840
order by okay remember the time stamp

2:26:41.439,2:26:46.479
that we passed in we'll say order by

2:26:43.840,2:26:48.080
the timestamp ascending okay so order by

2:26:46.479,2:26:49.359
timestamp

2:26:48.080,2:26:50.399
ascending

2:26:49.359,2:26:51.520
okay

2:26:50.399,2:26:52.880
and then there you go so it's going to

2:26:51.520,2:26:54.160
order by the timestamp so now you can

2:26:52.880,2:26:55.680
see this will go ahead and give me the

2:26:54.160,2:26:57.359
room messages

2:26:55.680,2:26:59.840
plural and this will get me the room

2:26:57.359,2:27:01.359
details okay so how do i check this this

2:26:59.840,2:27:03.439
actually is doing what it says it's

2:27:01.359,2:27:05.439
doing if i go ahead and pop open this

2:27:03.439,2:27:07.040
and i go ahead and say console.log let's

2:27:05.439,2:27:08.160
just check the room details first room

2:27:07.040,2:27:12.319
details

2:27:08.160,2:27:12.319
let's go ahead and do room messages

2:27:14.000,2:27:19.120
save and let's go ahead and see now you

2:27:15.760,2:27:21.920
can see look chat 25 26 25 has given us

2:27:19.120,2:27:23.200
the data back this is actually correct

2:27:21.920,2:27:25.920
if i say

2:27:23.200,2:27:25.920
dot data

2:27:26.319,2:27:29.920
and now you can see that it gets us back

2:27:27.680,2:27:31.359
the room details so in this case if i

2:27:29.920,2:27:33.680
click on the room i have to make sure

2:27:31.359,2:27:36.640
i'm inside of a room so in this case if

2:27:33.680,2:27:36.640
i go into

2:27:38.080,2:27:42.160
papa fam you can see that it gets me the

2:27:39.760,2:27:44.720
papa fam room we're going to abc gets me

2:27:42.160,2:27:46.160
abc the room okay and same with the room

2:27:44.720,2:27:47.680
messages but this will be a collection

2:27:46.160,2:27:49.120
of documents so you can see it works

2:27:47.680,2:27:51.680
okay it comes through

2:27:49.120,2:27:53.520
now how do we pass this over into our

2:27:51.680,2:27:55.680
chat input it's pretty simple actually

2:27:53.520,2:27:58.319
the way we do it is we pretty much go

2:27:55.680,2:28:00.560
down to our chat input and then here

2:27:58.319,2:28:02.960
where we have channel name we pass in

2:28:00.560,2:28:04.880
room details

2:28:02.960,2:28:06.160
and it can be maybe undefined so we need

2:28:04.880,2:28:08.240
to do that and then we say past in the

2:28:06.160,2:28:11.200
name and now we pass through the room

2:28:08.240,2:28:12.720
name inside of chat input i can actually

2:28:11.200,2:28:16.800
get the channel name

2:28:12.720,2:28:18.640
and here i can actually say message

2:28:16.800,2:28:20.720
channel name so now what you should be

2:28:18.640,2:28:22.000
able to see is that by default it says

2:28:20.720,2:28:23.439
message undefined because we're not

2:28:22.000,2:28:25.680
inside of a room and we can fix that

2:28:23.439,2:28:27.840
afterwards but if i click paper fam it

2:28:25.680,2:28:30.560
will go ahead and it will actually pass

2:28:27.840,2:28:32.160
that through as the value now have we

2:28:30.560,2:28:33.920
correctly passed it through as a

2:28:32.160,2:28:36.800
question channel name there we go

2:28:33.920,2:28:38.160
lowercase c boom saved

2:28:36.800,2:28:39.600
right

2:28:38.160,2:28:40.960
and then let's carry on the guys we are

2:28:39.600,2:28:43.680
literally come on let's keep going we're

2:28:40.960,2:28:45.600
almost at 650 likes that's incredible

2:28:43.680,2:28:46.399
honestly i'm i'm a bit mind blown today

2:28:45.600,2:28:48.240
like

2:28:46.399,2:28:50.880
we had a tech issue we lost we had to

2:28:48.240,2:28:52.640
start from zero 650 people came in and

2:28:50.880,2:28:54.880
like that's just mad

2:28:52.640,2:28:56.160
all right let's go ahead and then click

2:28:54.880,2:28:58.319
on this and there you go look it says

2:28:56.160,2:28:59.840

here we have the room name i'm going to

2:29:29.120,2:29:32.240
go ahead and do the same thing i'm going

2:29:30.160,2:29:35.680
to go ahead and pop into our jsx and

2:29:32.240,2:29:37.920
here i'll say roomdetails.data.name

2:29:35.680,2:29:39.840
okay so not data don't name let's go

2:29:37.920,2:29:41.200
ahead and hit save and let's do refresh

2:29:39.840,2:29:42.880
i remember by default it's going to be

2:29:41.200,2:29:44.160
undefined so it won't show any value

2:29:42.880,2:29:45.280
okay so we can go ahead and change that

2:29:44.160,2:29:46.960
afterwards

2:29:45.280,2:29:48.319
uh and then what i'll do is uh let's go

2:29:46.960,2:29:49.520
back to proper firm and you can see an

2:29:48.319,2:29:51.120
hour inside the pop-up fan room now

2:29:49.520,2:29:53.200
we're inside the abc room you see it

2:29:51.120,2:29:55.439
look works very very nice okay it works

2:29:53.200,2:29:56.960
very very slick right now at this point

2:29:55.439,2:29:59.120
what i'm going to do

2:29:56.960,2:30:00.960
is i'm going to go ahead and have it so

2:29:59.120,2:30:03.359
that we have

2:30:00.960,2:30:04.399
um let's just double check something i'm

2:30:03.359,2:30:06.319
going to go ahead and add so the

2:30:04.399,2:30:08.479
messages list up okay so we already have

2:30:06.319,2:30:10.080
the messages over here and what i want

2:30:08.479,2:30:12.640
to do is actually want to render through

2:30:10.080,2:30:14.800
those messages and actually sort of do

2:30:12.640,2:30:17.120
some magic with that so how do we do

2:30:14.800,2:30:19.840
that we go over here to chat messages i

2:30:17.120,2:30:22.399
go ahead open up my jsx and i say okay

2:30:19.840,2:30:24.240
let's go into the room messages

2:30:22.399,2:30:25.920
and it could be on can it could be

2:30:24.240,2:30:26.960
undefined at some point because it's a

2:30:25.920,2:30:28.160
async

2:30:26.960,2:30:29.920
it needs to fetch it i'm going to say if

2:30:28.160,2:30:32.000
every single document inside those

2:30:29.920,2:30:33.040
messages i'm going to have a bit of code

2:30:32.000,2:30:35.920
that runs okay and i'm going to

2:30:33.040,2:30:37.760
basically destructure that that message

2:30:35.920,2:30:39.280
and that has a message inside of it as a

2:30:37.760,2:30:42.160
timestamp remember when we push the

2:30:39.280,2:30:44.640
message in as a user and a user image

2:30:42.160,2:30:46.560
right and then this has doc.data so we

2:30:44.640,2:30:49.359
basically are pulling it apart from the

2:30:46.560,2:30:50.640
message um document okay

2:30:49.359,2:30:52.319
then what we're going to do is i'm going

2:30:50.640,2:30:54.240
to actually return

2:30:52.319,2:30:56.160
the following so i'm going to say return

2:30:54.240,2:30:58.720
and i'm going to basically create a

2:30:56.160,2:31:00.640
message component which is going to be

2:30:58.720,2:31:02.319
self enclosing and it's going to take

2:31:00.640,2:31:03.520
the following props so we'll have a key

2:31:02.319,2:31:04.399
because we're mapping through a bunch of

2:31:03.520,2:31:06.080
stuff

2:31:04.399,2:31:07.760
but what it's actually going to do

2:31:06.080,2:31:09.760
is this message component will take the

2:31:07.760,2:31:10.880
following information so it's obviously

2:31:09.760,2:31:12.160
going to freak out at this point because

2:31:10.880,2:31:13.840
it doesn't know what this message

2:31:12.160,2:31:15.040
component is okay so we need to go ahead

2:31:13.840,2:31:17.520
and create it so i'm going to grab

2:31:15.040,2:31:19.520
message go over here go to components

2:31:17.520,2:31:20.560
create message.js

2:31:19.520,2:31:23.359
save

2:31:20.560,2:31:25.040
do my little rfc trick wait for it boom

2:31:23.359,2:31:27.520
pop it in and then what we're going to

2:31:25.040,2:31:29.760
do is we're going to say const message

2:31:27.520,2:31:32.479
container right so message container

2:31:29.760,2:31:35.040
equals star div

2:31:32.479,2:31:36.960
all right start div boom boom and i'm

2:31:35.040,2:31:38.800
going to go ahead and pop this in now

2:31:36.960,2:31:40.960
the message container let's go over to

2:31:38.800,2:31:42.880
message i like this song

2:31:40.960,2:31:45.680
all right so i'm gonna go ahead and pull

2:31:42.880,2:31:47.760
in styled import start from style

2:31:45.680,2:31:50.800
components there we go and guys we are

2:31:47.760,2:31:53.280
literally near four likes away from 650

2:31:50.800,2:31:54.880
let's go come on we almost there so

2:31:53.280,2:31:56.720
message container now i'm gonna go ahead

2:31:54.880,2:31:58.479
and pop this in there

2:31:56.720,2:31:59.439
and then inside the message container

2:31:58.479,2:32:00.960
we're going to have a few things right

2:31:59.439,2:32:02.240
so we've already got a few things being

2:32:00.960,2:32:05.359
passed in so firstly i'm going to go

2:32:02.240,2:32:06.800
ahead and import this inside the chat

2:32:05.359,2:32:08.800
boom save

2:32:06.800,2:32:10.000
and there you go okay so now inside a

2:32:08.800,2:32:11.120
puppet phone we should have a message

2:32:10.000,2:32:12.479
here right but it's not actually being

2:32:11.120,2:32:14.640
rendered because we have nothing being

2:32:12.479,2:32:16.160
rendered here so firstly this takes a

2:32:14.640,2:32:17.600
few props like we just passed in so i'm

2:32:16.160,2:32:19.600
going to destructure the props and

2:32:17.600,2:32:22.399
inside we have the message the time

2:32:19.600,2:32:24.560
stamp and a few extra things okay so we

2:32:22.399,2:32:27.520
have message timestamp user and user

2:32:24.560,2:32:30.000
image okay message timestamp user and

2:32:27.520,2:32:30.880
user image three likes away let's go

2:32:30.000,2:32:33.439
guys

2:32:30.880,2:32:35.760
wow this is so sick man i can't believe

2:32:33.439,2:32:37.200
that we're actually going so fast uh

2:32:35.760,2:32:38.800

to have a few things on the image the

2:33:11.680,2:33:16.399
image source is going to be the user

2:33:13.200,2:33:18.080
image prop okay so the user image prop

2:33:16.399,2:33:19.920

2:33:18.080,2:33:22.479
you can see that it pops through now so

2:33:19.920,2:33:23.920

2:33:22.479,2:33:25.520
and make sure i'm in the correct chat

2:33:23.920,2:33:27.120
yes because every test remember it's

2:33:25.520,2:33:30.479
passing through as me right now there we

2:33:34.880,2:33:38.560
do that all right

2:33:36.479,2:33:41.359
so let's go ahead and say

2:33:38.560,2:33:43.439
uh let's have a message info right so

2:33:41.359,2:33:45.040
message info container which i'm going

2:33:43.439,2:33:47.040
to create so this is going to be message

2:33:45.040,2:33:49.120
info which is going to be a similar

2:33:47.040,2:33:50.560
sort of div the styled component dip

2:33:49.120,2:33:51.760
message info

2:33:50.560,2:33:53.359
and then i'm going to go ahead and say

2:33:51.760,2:33:56.240
okay message info

2:33:53.359,2:33:58.479
and then thank you anchor appreciated so

2:33:56.240,2:34:01.040
here we're going to say h4 and inside of

2:33:58.479,2:34:02.399
that we're going to say user

2:34:01.040,2:34:04.319
and then i'm gonna basically have some

2:34:02.399,2:34:06.640
little kind of you know i'm gonna add a

2:34:04.319,2:34:08.319
jsx parentheses block and then we're

2:34:06.640,2:34:09.920
gonna say span

2:34:08.319,2:34:12.160
okay now i'm gonna span a few things

2:34:09.920,2:34:13.840
right please don't spam the chat dude uh

2:34:12.160,2:34:15.920
otherwise i'm gonna kick you out right

2:34:13.840,2:34:18.319
so here i'm gonna span and i'm going to

2:34:15.920,2:34:20.240
put in the following okay ayesha what's

2:34:18.319,2:34:22.240
up nice i don't see any chat

2:34:20.240,2:34:24.399
conversation in twitch it's not but in

2:34:22.240,2:34:25.439
uh in youtube it's going off pretty good

2:34:24.399,2:34:27.120
um

2:34:25.439,2:34:28.640
so now we get the timestamp right now

2:34:27.120,2:34:31.760
how do we change the timestamp that we

2:34:28.640,2:34:33.280
get from firebase into a readable string

2:34:31.760,2:34:35.120
and this is the line of code to do it

2:34:33.280,2:34:36.560
okay so you guys can maybe break this

2:34:35.120,2:34:38.160
one down in your own time but i'll

2:34:36.560,2:34:40.319
explain quickly it basically creates a

2:34:38.160,2:34:41.840
new date object from the timestamp we

2:34:40.319,2:34:43.680
need to convert it with this two-day

2:34:41.840,2:34:46.319
object which allows us to convert and

2:34:43.680,2:34:48.560
then here what i need to go ahead and do

2:34:46.319,2:34:50.160
is say two utc string so if i save it

2:34:48.560,2:34:53.040
now we should be able to see like sunny

2:34:50.160,2:34:55.120
sanger on this time spent sent that

2:34:53.040,2:34:56.240
message okay so it looks really good and

2:34:55.120,2:34:58.319
the next thing i wanna do is underneath

2:34:56.240,2:35:00.000
this i'm gonna have a p tag and the p

2:34:58.319,2:35:01.120
tag is just going to have the message

2:35:00.000,2:35:02.240
itself

2:35:01.120,2:35:03.200
okay so it's going to have the message

2:35:02.240,2:35:05.040
itself

2:35:03.200,2:35:08.080
see like testing testing if i say abc

2:35:05.040,2:35:10.560
abc abc enter the message down here says

2:35:08.080,2:35:12.160
abc abc abc okay so it's very hard to

2:35:10.560,2:35:14.640
see that but you guys can see it's at

2:35:12.160,2:35:15.840
the bottom i promise it's there right so

2:35:14.640,2:35:18.080
the first thing i want to do is start

2:35:15.840,2:35:20.000
making this look like it's the way that

2:35:18.080,2:35:22.399
it should look okay guys we're almost at

2:35:20.000,2:35:24.240
70 honestly really almost at 70.

2:35:22.399,2:35:26.240
right um so what we're going to do now

2:35:24.240,2:35:27.280
is go into our message container right

2:35:26.240,2:35:30.640
so here

2:35:27.280,2:35:32.240
and i'm going to say display flex

2:35:30.640,2:35:34.720
right and then i'm going to basically go

2:35:32.240,2:35:37.280
ahead and say align item center align

2:35:34.720,2:35:40.640
item center

2:35:37.280,2:35:42.720
and then we'll say padding of 20 pixels

2:35:40.640,2:35:44.880
20 pixels okay and then here i'm going

2:35:42.720,2:35:46.240
to say go and target the image and make

2:35:44.880,2:35:47.840
the height of

2:35:46.240,2:35:50.160
okay

2:35:47.840,2:35:51.439
50 pixels

2:35:50.160,2:35:53.290
all right and then we'll say border

2:35:51.439,2:35:55.920
radius

2:35:53.290,2:35:57.200
[Music]

2:35:55.920,2:35:59.359
all right let's just say

2:35:57.200,2:36:01.439
water radius

2:35:59.359,2:36:03.760
of eight pixels there we go

2:36:01.439,2:36:06.240
okay and look at that pretty cool right

2:36:03.760,2:36:07.840
it's pretty cool right so now what we're

2:36:06.240,2:36:09.359
going to do is we're going to go ahead

2:36:07.840,2:36:11.120
and you see that's actually starting to

2:36:09.359,2:36:12.960
look similar to the sort of go that

2:36:11.120,2:36:14.319
we're trying to get to okay so we have

2:36:12.960,2:36:15.760
the image set so the next thing i'll do

2:36:14.319,2:36:17.120
is target the message info so i'm going

2:36:15.760,2:36:18.880
to go to the message info and say

2:36:17.120,2:36:20.479
padding left i don't want to touch that

2:36:18.880,2:36:22.080
next button okay so panning left of 10

2:36:20.479,2:36:23.920
pixels

2:36:22.080,2:36:25.120
you can use padding or margin there's up

2:36:23.920,2:36:27.359
to you i'm going to target the h4 and

2:36:25.120,2:36:29.600
inside the span tag i'm going to target

2:36:27.359,2:36:31.200
something we'll say inside the span tag

2:36:29.600,2:36:33.600
i'm going to do a color of gray font

2:36:31.200,2:36:35.200
weight of 300 margin left 4 pixels font

2:36:33.600,2:36:37.280
size 10 and this is going to make the

2:36:35.200,2:36:38.960
timestamp a lot smaller

2:36:37.280,2:36:42.000
there you go and it starts to look a lot

2:36:38.960,2:36:44.000
more like we wanted it to look at that

2:36:42.000,2:36:46.080
amazing stuff so this

2:36:44.000,2:36:47.040
is so dope

2:36:46.080,2:36:48.720
okay

2:36:47.040,2:36:51.359
that's pretty cool right really really

2:36:48.720,2:36:53.359
cool uh anshu please don't spam dude

2:36:51.359,2:36:54.960
um so at this point this is really

2:36:53.359,2:36:56.960
really good now if i click on abc and i

2:36:54.960,2:36:58.240
say hello can you see what just happened

2:36:56.960,2:37:00.000
there look it actually just changed

2:36:58.240,2:37:01.840
based on what i've got entered in here

2:37:00.000,2:37:02.880
and it will load up the messages inside

2:37:01.840,2:37:05.520
that room

2:37:02.880,2:37:07.200
and it just works just works so clean

2:37:05.520,2:37:08.880
that's amazing right it works really

2:37:07.200,2:37:11.280
really good really clean

2:37:08.880,2:37:13.600
okay now how do i get this though right

2:37:11.280,2:37:15.520
so if i go into a new channel

2:37:13.600,2:37:16.800
right if i go into a new channel how

2:37:15.520,2:37:18.479
does it automatically scroll to the

2:37:16.800,2:37:20.399
bottom and if i want to add a new

2:37:18.479,2:37:23.200
message so let's say testing

2:37:20.399,2:37:25.760
how do i get that look at that abc wow

2:37:23.200,2:37:27.520
how do we do that trick right so we want

2:37:25.760,2:37:29.680
to get that trick happening firstly you

2:37:27.520,2:37:32.000
need to smash the thumbs up button

2:37:29.680,2:37:34.479
joking i just had to do like a you know

2:37:32.000,2:37:37.760
what's his name uh graham stefan sort of

2:37:34.479,2:37:39.040
kind of vibe there oh let's carry on

2:37:37.760,2:37:41.120
right

2:37:39.040,2:37:44.000
look at the numbers going up man this is

2:37:41.120,2:37:45.760
crazy okay

2:37:44.000,2:37:47.439
all right so now what we're gonna do yes

2:37:45.760,2:37:48.640
this will be everything that's kind of

2:37:47.439,2:37:50.560
you're seeing now is going to be on the

2:37:48.640,2:37:52.160
channel after so it goes straight up on

2:37:50.560,2:37:53.439
the channel after so you can rewatch it

2:37:52.160,2:37:55.439
so at this point what i'm going to do is

2:37:53.439,2:37:57.359
we have the messages here okay so in

2:37:55.439,2:37:59.680
order to get that sort of auto scroll

2:37:57.359,2:38:02.800
functionality what you need to do is a

2:37:59.680,2:38:05.280
very neat little trick okay so we render

2:38:02.800,2:38:07.920
the messages over here okay so just

2:38:05.280,2:38:10.399
underneath the end of those messages i'm

2:38:07.920,2:38:12.000
going to create an a sort of a div

2:38:10.399,2:38:13.600
called chat bottom

2:38:12.000,2:38:15.439
okay so i'm going gonna create a div

2:38:13.600,2:38:17.920
called chat bottom and this is literally

2:38:15.439,2:38:20.000
just gonna be a div an empty div okay so

2:38:17.920,2:38:21.280
you don't even need to maybe have uh i'm

2:38:20.000,2:38:22.640
gonna give a little bit of padding to

2:38:21.280,2:38:23.760
the bottom though actually

2:38:22.640,2:38:26.080
so what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna create

2:38:23.760,2:38:27.600
a start component at the bottom so and

2:38:26.080,2:38:29.359
it's gonna have a panning bottom of 200

2:38:27.600,2:38:31.680
pixels and there is a reason why we did

2:38:29.359,2:38:33.520
that okay so

2:38:31.680,2:38:35.680
so wait for this to load boom

2:38:33.520,2:38:36.960
and there we go okay so now what i'm

2:38:35.680,2:38:39.200
going to do is i'm going to go ahead and

2:38:36.960,2:38:41.359
say chat bottom now what i need to do is

2:38:39.200,2:38:42.800
i need to give this a reference and i

2:38:41.359,2:38:44.640
will show you why because we're going to

2:38:42.800,2:38:47.280
do some pretty damn cool little trick

2:38:44.640,2:38:48.800
right now okay so

2:38:47.280,2:38:50.080
here we've got he's saying are you just

2:38:48.800,2:38:51.520
front and rear reactor does he have no

2:38:50.080,2:38:52.720
back and i haven't used firebase before

2:38:51.520,2:38:54.080
so right now this is actually more of a

2:38:52.720,2:38:55.680
front-end build the firebase powers

2:38:54.080,2:38:57.280
everything on the back handles it all

2:38:55.680,2:38:58.960
for us but i do do full stack

2:38:57.280,2:39:00.479
development yes so what i'm going to do

2:38:58.960,2:39:02.319
is chat ref i'm going to go to the top

2:39:00.479,2:39:03.120
and create a piece of reference so i'm

2:39:02.319,2:39:05.120
going to go ahead and get rid of these

2:39:03.120,2:39:07.520
console logs at the top i'm going to say

2:39:05.120,2:39:09.200
cons chat ref equals user f and i'm

2:39:07.520,2:39:11.200
going to go and say initialize it with a

2:39:09.200,2:39:13.120
value of no to begin with

2:39:11.200,2:39:14.319
okay now use ref we need to go ahead and

2:39:13.120,2:39:16.080
import that so i'm going to go ahead and

2:39:14.319,2:39:19.280
boom we import it from

2:39:16.080,2:39:20.800
react like so now to connect to my user

2:39:19.280,2:39:22.880
f to this i just go ahead and say ref

2:39:20.800,2:39:25.120
equals use rest and now i have a big

2:39:22.880,2:39:26.720
pointing at that the bottom of the chat

2:39:25.120,2:39:28.800
because think about it it maps out the

2:39:26.720,2:39:30.560
messages then we have an empty div at

2:39:28.800,2:39:32.800
the bottom and the reason why there's a

2:39:30.560,2:39:33.760
reason why we use this empty div

2:39:32.800,2:39:35.280
so

2:39:33.760,2:39:36.479
whenever this page loads i'm going to go

2:39:35.280,2:39:38.319
ahead and spam this chat right now

2:39:36.479,2:39:40.160
because i'm going to say hey something

2:39:38.319,2:39:42.080
like this right

2:39:40.160,2:39:43.359
there we go i'm gonna refresh and let's

2:39:42.080,2:39:44.560
see that we should have all of this

2:39:43.359,2:39:46.640
stuff popping

2:39:44.560,2:39:49.760
uh wait for it to load wait for it to

2:39:46.640,2:39:52.560
load wait for it to load

2:39:49.760,2:39:54.720
let's go into papa fam

2:39:52.560,2:39:57.120
it's just a bit slow right now but it

2:39:54.720,2:39:58.960
will work

2:39:57.120,2:40:00.640
okay there we go

2:39:58.960,2:40:02.319
nice so you see that that's just because

2:40:00.640,2:40:04.240
my internet right but can you see right

2:40:02.319,2:40:05.920
now how firstly we added the padding 200

2:40:04.240,2:40:07.439
so that way we can see the bottom and

2:40:05.920,2:40:09.760
the second thing that i wanted to do

2:40:07.439,2:40:11.359
guys is i wanted to so that when we go

2:40:09.760,2:40:13.279
on to like let's say we're on abc and

2:40:11.359,2:40:14.560
loads of messages if i go into papa fam

2:40:13.279,2:40:17.840
i want it to scroll to the bottom by

2:40:14.560,2:40:19.600
default okay so whoa ho

2:40:17.840,2:40:22.080

2:40:26.240,2:40:32.240
gig last year and you just dropped a

2:40:28.800,2:40:33.600
massive 27.99 euros that's like a dinner

2:40:32.240,2:40:35.920

2:40:33.600,2:40:37.520

2:40:39.840,2:40:43.600
much dude appreciate that man so the way

2:40:42.399,2:40:45.439
i'm gonna do this little trick is i'm

2:40:43.600,2:40:47.840
gonna have a use effect and the use

2:40:45.439,2:40:48.720
effect allows us to run a bit of code

2:40:47.840,2:40:51.439
when

2:40:48.720,2:40:52.479
the component mounts okay

2:40:51.439,2:40:54.319
so

2:40:52.479,2:40:56.080
use effects are written like such okay

2:40:54.319,2:40:58.080
so i actually cover this in my entire

2:40:56.080,2:40:59.840
full stack hero if anyone's watching an

2:40:58.080,2:41:02.479
interest in joining the papa fam two-day

2:40:59.840,2:41:03.920
cell empty it finishes in two days guys

2:41:02.479,2:41:05.520
first link in the description check it

2:41:03.920,2:41:07.840
out ff says sunny i've landed a job in

2:41:05.520,2:41:10.080
london at stores because of you dude

2:41:07.840,2:41:12.479
let's go for a beer man when london

2:41:10.080,2:41:14.880
lockdown's over let me know hit me up

2:41:12.479,2:41:16.560
all right so the use effect here right

2:41:14.880,2:41:18.960
we've already already imported over here

2:41:16.560,2:41:20.080
so i only want to sort of do it when

2:41:18.960,2:41:22.160
um

2:41:20.080,2:41:24.640
when the component mount as well as when

2:41:22.160,2:41:26.720
the room id changes okay so when the

2:41:24.640,2:41:27.920
room id changes

2:41:26.720,2:41:29.439
and what's really cool about these use

2:41:27.920,2:41:31.120
collections is they give you the loading

2:41:29.439,2:41:32.640
state and an error state i don't need

2:41:31.120,2:41:34.319
the aerostate but the loading state can

2:41:32.640,2:41:36.399
be handy here right so what i can

2:41:34.319,2:41:38.800
actually say here is that if the room is

2:41:36.399,2:41:40.720
loading this is firestore

2:41:38.800,2:41:42.880
right if the room is loading so if the

2:41:40.720,2:41:44.880
room is still loading with the loading

2:41:42.880,2:41:46.080
stage changes or re-fire this code and

2:41:44.880,2:41:47.920
what i want to do is i want to go to

2:41:46.080,2:41:49.600
that chat reference and i'm going to say

2:41:47.920,2:41:50.800
okay get the chat reference go to the

2:41:49.600,2:41:53.040
current thing you're pointing at and

2:41:50.800,2:41:54.880
scroll it into the view so save and what

2:41:53.040,2:41:56.800
happens is as soon as it loads it's

2:41:54.880,2:41:58.080
going to basically scroll me down so

2:41:56.800,2:41:59.680
this one it doesn't need to scroll down

2:41:58.080,2:42:01.840
but if i go to the papa fam watch how it

2:41:59.680,2:42:03.920
scrolls me to the bottom

2:42:01.840,2:42:06.560
boom scrolled me to the bottom

2:42:03.920,2:42:09.200
amazing works look really really nice

2:42:06.560,2:42:10.479
right it works right so

2:42:09.200,2:42:12.160
at this point and what you can do is you

2:42:10.479,2:42:14.960
can customize this with some really nice

2:42:12.160,2:42:16.319
little uh sort of additional extras okay

2:42:14.960,2:42:19.200
so what i can do is actually i can

2:42:16.319,2:42:20.960
actually add in this behavior smooth

2:42:19.200,2:42:23.040
right so if i go ahead and do this

2:42:20.960,2:42:24.960
behavior smooth now now look at this

2:42:23.040,2:42:26.880
guys if i go to abc and i go to the papa

2:42:24.960,2:42:28.960
fam it opens it up and it scrolls me to

2:42:26.880,2:42:31.279
the bottom now that's click

2:42:28.960,2:42:33.520
smash that thumbs up button that is damn

2:42:31.279,2:42:35.439
slick all right this is pretty cool

2:42:33.520,2:42:37.279
right that's pretty damn fun

2:42:35.439,2:42:38.800
all right now guys

2:42:37.279,2:42:40.960
if you're new to the channel you know

2:42:38.800,2:42:42.240
what to do subscribe it's going to be

2:42:40.960,2:42:44.960
big we're going to keep dropping these

2:42:42.240,2:42:47.760
bills but we're almost at 700 almost at

2:42:44.960,2:42:50.080
700 views right so let's carry on guys

2:42:47.760,2:42:51.439
700 likes sorry okay so what i'm going

2:42:50.080,2:42:53.439
to do now is every time i push your

2:42:51.439,2:42:55.359
message like look hello

2:42:53.439,2:42:56.800
see that oh it didn't actually throw me

2:42:55.359,2:42:58.560
to the bottom so i want to go ahead and

2:42:56.800,2:43:00.560
fix that so what i'm going to do is that

2:42:58.560,2:43:02.240
chat reference i had earlier i'm

2:43:00.560,2:43:04.240
actually going to go ahead and pass that

2:43:02.240,2:43:06.160
to my chat input

2:43:04.240,2:43:08.000
right as a prop so i'm going to say chat

2:43:06.160,2:43:09.600
reference i'm going to pass this as a

2:43:08.000,2:43:11.359
prop to

2:43:09.600,2:43:14.399
my

2:43:11.359,2:43:17.840
uh to the chat input right so chat ref

2:43:14.399,2:43:20.080
equals chat ref okay

2:43:17.840,2:43:22.000
so skier yes it would but this is sort

2:43:20.080,2:43:24.160
of those are additional features you can

2:43:22.000,2:43:25.680
go ahead and add on and things like that

2:43:24.160,2:43:27.520
you can obviously sort of you should add

2:43:25.680,2:43:28.800
lazy loading and things like that and

2:43:27.520,2:43:31.760
but this is sort of you know this is

2:43:28.800,2:43:33.600
enough for for uh one single bird okay

2:43:31.760,2:43:35.279
um so at this point chat ref okay we've

2:43:33.600,2:43:36.560
done that so we pass it through and then

2:43:35.279,2:43:38.560
i'm going to go ahead and grab it here

2:43:36.560,2:43:41.520
but good good couch

2:43:38.560,2:43:42.880
use my sql now i'm not using my sql uh

2:43:41.520,2:43:45.120
okay so at this point we've got the chat

2:43:42.880,2:43:47.359
reference here now what's cool right is

2:43:45.120,2:43:49.200
that when i go ahead and do chat input

2:43:47.359,2:43:51.279
because i passed it over here once i

2:43:49.200,2:43:53.439
send that message in all i need to do

2:43:51.279,2:43:56.640
now is basically go ahead and add do the

2:43:53.439,2:43:58.720
following i just say chat reference

2:43:56.640,2:44:00.479
dot current scroll into view same thing

2:43:58.720,2:44:02.399
but when i send a message inside of chat

2:44:00.479,2:44:03.680
input so now let's go ahead and check

2:44:02.399,2:44:05.200
this out

2:44:03.680,2:44:07.359
so let's go ahead and wait till this

2:44:05.200,2:44:08.800
loads up click papa fam and you can see

2:44:07.359,2:44:10.080
it should load up scroll to the bottom

2:44:08.800,2:44:10.880
and if i'm at the bottom over here and i

2:44:10.080,2:44:12.880
say

2:44:10.880,2:44:14.640
yolo

2:44:12.880,2:44:17.600
enter boom guys

2:44:14.640,2:44:19.920
look at that that's that's pretty damn

2:44:17.600,2:44:22.720
cool right it's a zero to hero course

2:44:19.920,2:44:24.080
live or video um so we have weekly live

2:44:22.720,2:44:25.359
coaching course dude so if you're

2:44:24.080,2:44:26.640
platinum you'll get a weekly coaching

2:44:25.359,2:44:28.720
call every single week if you're a

2:44:26.640,2:44:30.080
diamond you'll get a coach call every

2:44:28.720,2:44:31.840
week and then every fortnight an

2:44:30.080,2:44:34.560
additional coaching call which is pretty

2:44:31.840,2:44:36.479
damn intense so i'd recommend that but

2:44:34.560,2:44:37.920
platinum is the pack i recommend first

2:44:36.479,2:44:39.520
link in the description check it out we

2:44:37.920,2:44:40.960
also have the recorded content for the

2:44:39.520,2:44:43.600
modules so those are going to be

2:44:40.960,2:44:45.359
pre-roll coaching cool guys um that i go

2:44:43.600,2:44:46.880
ahead and do i record it and it gets

2:44:45.359,2:44:48.399
uploaded to the course so you get

2:44:46.880,2:44:49.680
honestly you get more and more content

2:44:48.399,2:44:51.760
as it goes and we also have a student

2:44:49.680,2:44:52.880
area where people publish games and all

2:44:51.760,2:44:54.560
sorts of stuff so

2:44:52.880,2:44:55.920
so sick honestly

2:44:54.560,2:44:57.120
let's hit 700 likes guys if you're

2:44:55.920,2:44:59.040
enjoying this right now smash that

2:44:57.120,2:45:00.720
thumbs up button uh it's crazy that we

2:44:59.040,2:45:03.439
have 134 people watching but we have

2:45:00.720,2:45:05.120
literally nearly 700 likes that's insane

2:45:03.439,2:45:06.640
really really appreciate you guys okay

2:45:05.120,2:45:08.800
so now what i'm gonna do

2:45:06.640,2:45:10.000
is i'm gonna go ahead and this is

2:45:08.800,2:45:12.160
actually working pretty good at this

2:45:10.000,2:45:13.840
point okay so now we're gonna go ahead

2:45:12.160,2:45:15.760
and do the authentication portion of

2:45:13.840,2:45:17.680
this build i think okay so if i go ahead

2:45:15.760,2:45:19.200
and refresh at this point you see like

2:45:17.680,2:45:20.720
it says message undefined and this sort

2:45:19.200,2:45:23.040
of stuff now

2:45:20.720,2:45:25.840
what i can do here is i can protect this

2:45:23.040,2:45:28.319
screen from showing this stuff if we do

2:45:25.840,2:45:30.720
not have this information okay and

2:45:28.319,2:45:33.120
that's a good idea i think to do right

2:45:30.720,2:45:35.359
so i'm only going to show any of this

2:45:33.120,2:45:36.160
stuff if we've selected a room right so

2:45:35.359,2:45:37.760
what i'm going to say is i'm going to

2:45:36.160,2:45:39.439
say okay only if we have the room

2:45:37.760,2:45:41.680
details

2:45:39.439,2:45:44.479
only if we have the room details and

2:45:41.680,2:45:48.640
if we have the room messages

2:45:44.479,2:45:50.319
should we then go ahead and load up this

2:45:48.640,2:45:52.560
all right this is a better practice to

2:45:50.319,2:45:54.479
have and this will basically go ahead

2:45:52.560,2:45:55.920
and protect so you see that right so now

2:45:54.479,2:45:58.000
we don't get anything in this we click a

2:45:55.920,2:45:59.439
channel and then it go ahead and uh it

2:45:58.000,2:46:01.680
goes ahead and loads it that's a lot

2:45:59.439,2:46:04.240
cleaner okay that that really looks a

2:46:01.680,2:46:05.520
lot more cleaner when we do that okay so

2:46:04.240,2:46:06.960
um

2:46:05.520,2:46:08.800
let's carry on so

2:46:06.960,2:46:11.840
the farm there you go

2:46:08.800,2:46:13.279
um nice this looks really good oh nice

2:46:11.840,2:46:14.399
kush says i use your slap videos

2:46:13.279,2:46:15.920
reference to build my real estate

2:46:14.399,2:46:17.680
website that's oh that's actually really

2:46:15.920,2:46:18.640
cool dude i'd love to hear more about

2:46:17.680,2:46:22.240
that

2:46:18.640,2:46:22.240
i'm getting into real estate myself now

2:46:22.560,2:46:26.160
okay carry on guys

2:46:24.880,2:46:28.240
so at this point we're going to go ahead

2:46:26.160,2:46:29.920
and implement the login authentication

2:46:28.240,2:46:31.359
and then we're going to refactor so that

2:46:29.920,2:46:32.880
these are actually pulling in your names

2:46:31.359,2:46:34.960
and we're going to go ahead and deploy

2:46:32.880,2:46:36.479
this bad boy and you guys are going to

2:46:34.960,2:46:38.160
be able to jump on this app and try it

2:46:36.479,2:46:40.240
for yourself so it's gonna be so sick

2:46:38.160,2:46:42.240
right let's do this i know the music is

2:46:40.240,2:46:45.279
sick i swear it's like becoming like a

2:46:42.240,2:46:48.080
coding dj i swear my i don't care my

2:46:45.279,2:46:49.840
music playlist for coding is the best

2:46:48.080,2:46:51.520
it's like the goat of all of all

2:46:49.840,2:46:53.040
playlists for going i don't care i'll

2:46:51.520,2:46:54.800
say that

2:46:53.040,2:46:56.319
it's clean man all right so at this

2:46:54.800,2:46:58.640
point i'm gonna go ahead and let's

2:46:56.319,2:47:01.200
imagine how do we set up a login system

2:46:58.640,2:47:03.359
okay so if we go into app.js this is

2:47:01.200,2:47:04.640
where the magical begins okay so app.js

2:47:03.359,2:47:07.600
is where everything sort of starts off

2:47:04.640,2:47:09.279
from so

2:47:07.600,2:47:12.160
so now what we're going to do is go

2:47:09.279,2:47:14.399
inside of app.js now this is really cool

2:47:12.160,2:47:16.319
okay so before we had to use use

2:47:14.399,2:47:18.479
something called on auth status right

2:47:16.319,2:47:20.640
and things like that um

2:47:18.479,2:47:24.399
that was why yes so what i'm going to do

2:47:20.640,2:47:27.040
is but now we have the handy react hooks

2:47:24.399,2:47:29.359
okay so i can go ahead import use auth

2:47:27.040,2:47:31.359
state which is a really cool hook and

2:47:29.359,2:47:33.200
this one is so damn good because what we

2:47:31.359,2:47:34.800
can do is we can say const user look at

2:47:33.200,2:47:36.960
this if i go ahead and drop this line of

2:47:34.800,2:47:38.880
code in this gives me the user it gives

2:47:36.960,2:47:40.000
me a loading status

2:47:38.880,2:47:41.680
and

2:47:40.000,2:47:43.200
you get the and all you need to do is

2:47:41.680,2:47:46.160
pass it the authentication and the

2:47:43.200,2:47:47.840
authentication we prepped earlier inside

2:47:46.160,2:47:50.080
of our local firebase file so if i hit

2:47:47.840,2:47:52.080
save on this now we should have the user

2:47:50.080,2:47:53.760
inside of our app.js now what's really

2:47:52.080,2:47:56.319
cool about this guys is that what we can

2:47:53.760,2:47:58.160
do is we can say okay

2:47:56.319,2:48:01.120
inside the router right inside the

2:47:58.160,2:48:04.160
router over here

2:48:01.120,2:48:07.439
if we have so if inside the router here

2:48:04.160,2:48:09.520
if we do not have a user then show a

2:48:07.439,2:48:10.560
login screen okay then show a login

2:48:09.520,2:48:12.640
screen

2:48:10.560,2:48:14.399
else and this is kind of a protected

2:48:12.640,2:48:16.640
route now because else it will render

2:48:14.399,2:48:18.560
the app okay so it will show the login

2:48:16.640,2:48:20.880
screen if you if there's no user present

2:48:18.560,2:48:22.000
it says login is not defined makes sense

2:48:20.880,2:48:24.080
so we need to go ahead and create the

2:48:22.000,2:48:25.439
login so here what i'm going to do is

2:48:24.080,2:48:28.080
i'm going to go ahead and create a login

2:48:25.439,2:48:30.399
component login.js boom

2:48:28.080,2:48:32.399
pop that in rfce

2:48:30.399,2:48:34.640
and guys almost at 700 likes this is

2:48:32.399,2:48:37.600
insane let's keep going and here i'm

2:48:34.640,2:48:40.720
going to say const login container

2:48:37.600,2:48:43.200
equals style.diff

2:48:40.720,2:48:45.040
boom boom like so i'm going to go back

2:48:43.200,2:48:48.399
to my app.js

2:48:45.040,2:48:50.880
over here my login do my import

2:48:48.399,2:48:52.399
there we go vlog we just imported it and

2:48:50.880,2:48:55.520
then what i do

2:48:52.399,2:48:58.080
open up login.js and then in here i need

2:48:55.520,2:48:59.200
my styled components so i'm gonna pull

2:48:58.080,2:49:01.040
them in

2:48:59.200,2:49:03.279
and i'm gonna have my login container

2:49:01.040,2:49:04.960
over right here perfect and there you go

2:49:03.279,2:49:06.640
we have a login right and it's not

2:49:04.960,2:49:09.439
working yet we're almost there though

2:49:06.640,2:49:11.040
all right so login container right

2:49:09.439,2:49:13.359
inside the login container i'm actually

2:49:11.040,2:49:15.439
going to have an inner login container

2:49:13.359,2:49:16.880
right so i'm going to log in

2:49:15.439,2:49:18.479
in a container and i'll make sure i'll

2:49:16.880,2:49:20.720
show you why we do this it's going to

2:49:18.479,2:49:22.560
help us out in just a sec

2:49:20.720,2:49:24.640
okay so at this point what i'm going to

2:49:22.560,2:49:29.040
do is and guys we are three likes away

2:49:24.640,2:49:32.080

2:49:34.080,2:49:37.040
all right so now log in in a container

2:49:36.080,2:49:38.080
what we're going to do here and the

2:49:37.040,2:49:39.840
reason why we see a white screen is

2:49:38.080,2:49:42.000
because we do not have a user that is

2:49:39.840,2:49:44.240
inside okay so what i'm going to do is

2:49:42.000,2:49:46.399
i'm going to have the image and this is

2:49:44.240,2:49:47.840
an image of slack i'm going to pop an

2:49:46.399,2:49:49.439
image of slack in there and we should

2:49:47.840,2:49:53.040
see uh login in the container is not

2:49:49.439,2:49:55.040
defined so boom there we go 700 likes

2:49:53.040,2:49:57.120
700 likes

2:49:55.040,2:49:58.240
and we have a hundred and so a hundred

2:49:57.120,2:50:00.240
and

2:49:58.240,2:50:02.800
forty people watching across platforms

2:50:16.080,2:50:20.640
huge i don't like that the slack logo

2:50:17.760,2:50:21.840
okay so um let's carry on so what i'm

2:50:20.640,2:50:23.520
going to do with the login in the

2:50:21.840,2:50:24.720
container i'm going to target that image

2:50:23.520,2:50:26.479
and i'm going to make it smaller

2:50:24.720,2:50:28.160
immediately so that way we can start

2:50:26.479,2:50:31.120
seeing things all right so here i'm

2:50:28.160,2:50:32.640
going to say okay target the image

2:50:31.120,2:50:34.240
i'll get the image and then i'm going to

2:50:32.640,2:50:36.720
say okay object fit contain to keep the

2:50:34.240,2:50:38.880
aspect ratio

2:50:36.720,2:50:42.720
object fit contain and then i'm going to

2:50:38.880,2:50:42.720
go ahead and say height of 100 pixels

2:50:43.520,2:50:47.520
right over 100 pixels i don't even care

2:50:45.120,2:50:50.319
this slack this slack build is damn dope

2:50:47.520,2:50:52.960
margin bottom of 40 pixels and then save

2:50:50.319,2:50:55.040
and boom look at that looks fresh right

2:50:52.960,2:50:56.160
now for the logging container over here

2:50:55.040,2:50:58.720
what i'm going to do is i'm going to say

2:50:56.160,2:51:00.880
okay let's give it a background color a

2:50:58.720,2:51:03.200
height of 100 view height display grid

2:51:00.880,2:51:05.600
and place item center this gives it a

2:51:03.200,2:51:07.680
very nice extra sort of it will center

2:51:05.600,2:51:08.560
the element like so that looks pretty

2:51:07.680,2:51:10.880
clean

2:51:08.560,2:51:13.439
looks good all right looks good now for

2:51:10.880,2:51:14.960
the inner container what i'm going to do

2:51:13.439,2:51:18.000
is i'm going to go ahead give it padding

2:51:14.960,2:51:19.520
of 10 100 pixels a text align center

2:51:18.000,2:51:20.800
background color is going to be white

2:51:19.520,2:51:22.640
and i'm going to give a border radius of

2:51:20.800,2:51:25.359
10 pixels and i'm going to show you a

2:51:22.640,2:51:26.800
little cool trick okay so at this point

2:51:25.359,2:51:29.680
you guys can see it's got a nice little

2:51:26.800,2:51:32.240
border radius and it looks okay right

2:51:29.680,2:51:34.800
but i'm going to show you how crazy

2:51:32.240,2:51:37.680
small tweaks are in css i swear to god

2:51:34.800,2:51:39.040
can we hit 750. 800. i swear we're going

2:51:37.680,2:51:41.040
to keep on growing i don't know where

2:51:39.040,2:51:42.640
these likes are coming from thank you

2:51:41.040,2:51:44.800
keep on just smash the thumbs up button

2:51:42.640,2:51:46.800
if you're enjoying this but guys fabian

2:51:44.800,2:51:48.640
van dyke yes you won in the challenge as

2:51:46.800,2:51:50.640
well do you appreciate you so guys check

2:51:48.640,2:51:52.240
out this little trick right very small

2:51:50.640,2:51:54.399
differences right so this is a very

2:51:52.240,2:51:56.720
subtle box shadow you can just copy but

2:51:54.399,2:51:59.200
look how amazing the effect it has right

2:51:56.720,2:52:01.279
so a box shadow is about to be dropped

2:51:59.200,2:52:03.279
look at that i swear to god like look a

2:52:01.279,2:52:06.000
tiny little difference and all of a

2:52:03.279,2:52:08.240
sudden the whole ui is clean now

2:52:06.000,2:52:09.840
all right so this is really cool uh

2:52:08.240,2:52:11.279
redirects can protect you but this

2:52:09.840,2:52:12.479
actually sort of protects you at a much

2:52:11.279,2:52:14.000
stronger level because it just it

2:52:12.479,2:52:16.479
doesn't even load the component in the

2:52:14.000,2:52:18.000
first place a redirect there is a moment

2:52:16.479,2:52:19.920
where it kind of catches you then

2:52:18.000,2:52:21.279
redirects you okay so i wouldn't i would

2:52:19.920,2:52:24.240
say do it this way

2:52:21.279,2:52:25.520
to be sure now what we're going to do

2:52:24.240,2:52:26.800
we're going to reach them yeah i don't

2:52:25.520,2:52:29.600
know how to pronounce that one but a

2:52:26.800,2:52:31.120
good gazillion likes um so now what

2:52:29.600,2:52:32.800
we're going to do is inside of here

2:52:31.120,2:52:35.439
we've got the image and i'm going to go

2:52:32.800,2:52:36.720
ahead and say let's have a div of login

2:52:35.439,2:52:38.960
text we're going to have some login text

2:52:36.720,2:52:40.640
here okay so i guess what we can do is

2:52:38.960,2:52:42.560
remember we have a h1 okay and then

2:52:40.640,2:52:46.319

and then what i'm going to do is i'm

2:53:18.080,2:53:21.520
going to have a material ui button okay

2:53:20.080,2:53:22.840
now the material ui button is going to

2:53:21.520,2:53:25.840
say sign in with

2:53:22.840,2:53:27.359
google okay sign in with google like so

2:53:25.840,2:53:29.040
and then i'm going to hit save

2:53:27.359,2:53:30.800
and now what i'm going to do is say type

2:53:29.040,2:53:33.120
submit

2:53:30.800,2:53:34.720
type submit

2:53:33.120,2:53:36.800
like so and then what i'm going to say

2:53:34.720,2:53:38.319
is on click

2:53:36.800,2:53:40.319
i unclick and i'm going to basically

2:53:38.319,2:53:41.840
trigger off a sign in function

2:53:40.319,2:53:43.920
okay now i need to create this sign in

2:53:41.840,2:53:46.240
function so firstly i need to import the

2:53:43.920,2:53:48.479
button from material ui core so i'm

2:53:46.240,2:53:49.920
going to go ahead and do this

2:53:48.479,2:53:51.680
and then i'm going to go ahead and say

2:53:49.920,2:53:54.240
this

2:53:51.680,2:53:56.640
where is it material material material

2:53:54.240,2:53:57.840
ui uh there we go save and then the sign

2:53:56.640,2:53:59.279
in function i'm gonna go ahead and say

2:53:57.840,2:54:03.040
consignment

2:53:59.279,2:54:03.760
const i'm gonna say const sign in equals

2:54:03.040,2:54:06.080
e

2:54:03.760,2:54:08.560
boom boom and say e dot

2:54:06.080,2:54:09.840
like so okay like this

2:54:08.560,2:54:11.520
and then what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna

2:54:09.840,2:54:13.680
say okay now this is where the fun part

2:54:11.520,2:54:15.200
comes in okay so look it's got a sign in

2:54:13.680,2:54:17.200
with google bond but that looks a bit

2:54:15.200,2:54:19.279
trash at the moment okay so this button

2:54:17.200,2:54:21.920
looks ugly right and i'll admit it does

2:54:19.279,2:54:23.200
not look nice okay so

2:54:21.920,2:54:25.439
what first thing i'm going to do is i'm

2:54:23.200,2:54:27.120
going to go in here i'm going to target

2:54:25.439,2:54:29.120
the button all right i'm going to say

2:54:27.120,2:54:30.720
okay the button should have a margin top

2:54:29.120,2:54:32.399
50 pixels and i'm going to do a few

2:54:30.720,2:54:34.000
things i'm going to make the text

2:54:32.399,2:54:35.760
i'm going to change the transformer text

2:54:34.000,2:54:36.800
change the background color to a green

2:54:35.760,2:54:38.399
because by default everything is

2:54:36.800,2:54:40.240
uppercase so it's going to be it's going

2:54:38.399,2:54:42.960
to be a lot better right jay says sunny

2:54:40.240,2:54:44.560
the true beast jay we're nearly like 750

2:54:42.960,2:54:46.080
likes dude and the whole thing like

2:55:26.479,2:55:34.960
the entire google login in like one line

2:55:30.319,2:55:36.319
of code right one line of code right one

2:55:34.960,2:55:37.840
line of code right are you ready for

2:55:36.319,2:55:39.680
this one line of code is gonna do the

2:55:37.840,2:55:41.040
whole google login are you ready for

2:55:39.680,2:55:43.359
this this is where it's just like

2:55:41.040,2:55:44.640
unbelievable power right so here i'm

2:55:43.359,2:55:46.240
gonna say auth

2:55:44.640,2:55:48.399
i'm gonna pull in my auth from my local

2:55:46.240,2:55:50.880
firebase i'm gonna say sign in with

2:55:48.399,2:55:52.399
pop-up

2:55:50.880,2:55:54.080
boom okay

2:55:52.399,2:55:56.640
then i'm gonna go ahead and pass in the

2:55:54.080,2:55:58.560
pop-up now the pop-up is the provider

2:55:56.640,2:55:59.920
that we set up earlier okay so it's a

2:55:58.560,2:56:02.319
provider remember we actually pulled

2:55:59.920,2:56:03.760
that in from our local firebase file so

2:56:02.319,2:56:05.040
i'm going to go ahead and pull that in

2:56:03.760,2:56:06.720
and then i'm going to say okay that's

2:56:05.040,2:56:08.479
all good and then i don't need to do

2:56:06.720,2:56:09.680
anything after i've signed in i'm just

2:56:08.479,2:56:11.680
going to make sure that i catch any

2:56:09.680,2:56:13.120
errors okay so if there is an error i'm

2:56:11.680,2:56:15.760
going to alert the user of the error

2:56:13.120,2:56:18.479
i'll say error.message

2:56:15.760,2:56:20.240
right okay pretty cool all right let's

2:56:18.479,2:56:21.920
just let's go ahead and see if this all

2:56:20.240,2:56:24.160
works right i mean like that seems a bit

2:56:21.920,2:56:25.439
too easy to be to be true right

2:56:24.160,2:56:27.439
so i'm gonna go ahead and hit sign in

2:56:25.439,2:56:28.720
with google okay

2:56:27.439,2:56:30.560
pretty cool remember you need to you

2:56:28.720,2:56:32.479
need to enable that on the the the

2:56:30.560,2:56:34.560
firebase platform i'm gonna go to the

2:56:32.479,2:56:37.359
paparat team account

2:56:34.560,2:56:37.359

2:56:45.359,2:56:50.720
right and what's so cool about this is

2:56:47.520,2:56:53.600
that if i go to app.js literally guys

2:56:50.720,2:56:55.279
this is doing all the hard work for us

2:56:53.600,2:56:57.279
right now this right here is doing

2:56:55.279,2:56:59.920
everything for us um i'm actually gonna

2:56:57.279,2:57:02.319

do is we're going to go into the header

2:57:24.319,2:57:28.399
and start implementing or using the

2:57:26.560,2:57:30.960
user's information where it's needed all

2:57:28.399,2:57:33.120
right this song gets me so hyped up this

2:57:30.960,2:57:34.319
is when we first dropped announced the

2:57:33.120,2:57:35.760
papa fam

2:57:34.319,2:57:37.359
this is where that vibe comes this is

2:57:35.760,2:57:39.200
what it's all about right this is what i

2:57:37.359,2:57:40.640
try and communicate in these videos

2:57:39.200,2:57:43.840
that's what we do guys all right so now

2:57:40.640,2:57:47.359
we're gonna do is go over to header

2:57:43.840,2:57:47.359
and then we're gonna jump into

2:57:48.560,2:57:51.680
alex says what is this playlist what is

2:57:50.479,2:57:54.080
the song

2:57:51.680,2:57:55.680
this is like the papa fam anthem dude

2:57:54.080,2:57:57.600
this is called don't want to sleep by

2:57:55.680,2:57:59.359
swift 7th

2:57:57.600,2:58:01.120
and we don't want to sleep here dude we

2:57:59.359,2:58:03.040
do not want to sleep so header avatar

2:58:01.120,2:58:04.720
right so i'm going to go into my

2:58:03.040,2:58:07.840
header

2:58:04.720,2:58:10.090
and i'm going to go ahead and say okay

2:58:07.840,2:58:11.359
i'm going to basically go ahead and say

2:58:10.090,2:58:13.439
[Music]

2:58:11.359,2:58:14.479
hey i'm going to say okay the source is

2:58:13.439,2:58:16.560
going to be

2:58:14.479,2:58:18.880
oops the source is going to be

2:58:16.560,2:58:22.000
the user and it could be undefined we're

2:58:18.880,2:58:24.319
gonna say the photo url okay photo url

2:58:22.000,2:58:25.920
like so and then what i'm gonna do is

2:58:24.319,2:58:27.120
i'm gonna actually gonna have the

2:58:25.920,2:58:28.560
alternative as well it's gonna be the

2:58:27.120,2:58:31.120
users displaying it now how do i get

2:58:28.560,2:58:32.720
these values okay so remember we can

2:58:31.120,2:58:34.640
actually just pull this in using that

2:58:32.720,2:58:35.760
neat little use auto state hook from

2:58:34.640,2:58:37.279
firebase

2:58:35.760,2:58:40.240
now that's as simple as it is honestly

2:58:37.279,2:58:42.319
that gives us the user and it just works

2:58:40.240,2:58:43.680
papa found the movie i like that i like

2:58:42.319,2:58:46.160
that dude what about the movie can you

2:58:43.680,2:58:47.600
imagine that holy crap

2:58:46.160,2:58:49.359
i'd watch that

2:58:47.600,2:58:51.200
i'd literally watch it i'll be the one

2:58:49.359,2:58:52.080
that someone will be acting

2:58:51.200,2:58:54.640
right

2:58:52.080,2:58:57.200
i'm gonna import there we go safe

2:58:54.640,2:58:59.600
mama says loving this ah there she is

2:58:57.200,2:59:00.560
all right so now you can see we sign in

2:58:59.600,2:59:02.479
now

2:59:00.560,2:59:05.359
there's an issue with that right because

2:59:02.479,2:59:06.479
the sources use a photo url and it

2:59:05.359,2:59:08.319
didn't work

2:59:06.479,2:59:09.920
right so at this point what i want to do

2:59:08.319,2:59:11.600
is firstly i want to go ahead and make

2:59:09.920,2:59:15.200
sure that this is all done correct so

2:59:11.600,2:59:17.359
let's save let's refresh

2:59:15.200,2:59:18.960
and the header right interesting so the

2:59:17.359,2:59:20.399
source isn't actually being passed in as

2:59:18.960,2:59:23.200
we wanted it to

2:59:20.399,2:59:25.600
and this is because we have header

2:59:23.200,2:59:27.439
avatar this is using the correct avatar

2:59:25.600,2:59:30.080
one so boom

2:59:27.439,2:59:32.880
hover pointer start avatar avatar is

2:59:30.080,2:59:33.840
over here material ui call done cool

2:59:32.880,2:59:35.040
okay so i'm going to go ahead and make

2:59:33.840,2:59:36.399
this very easier to read so we can see

2:59:35.040,2:59:38.399
it and then what i'm going to do is i

2:59:36.399,2:59:39.840
actually want to make the avatar have on

2:59:38.399,2:59:41.600
click will actually go ahead and do an

2:59:39.840,2:59:42.880
anonymous function in line inline it'll

2:59:41.600,2:59:44.720
use the authentication and just

2:59:42.880,2:59:46.479
basically calls a sign out function

2:59:44.720,2:59:48.319
which actually signs us out of the app

2:59:46.479,2:59:51.760
so with that alone we should actually

2:59:48.319,2:59:53.760
have everything we need okay so oh man

2:59:51.760,2:59:55.359
this is another one that we had this is

2:59:53.760,2:59:57.920
literally all the songs that we had when

2:59:55.359,2:59:59.920
we first dropped it honestly it touches

2:59:57.920,3:00:01.760
imagine christopher nolan directing a

2:59:59.920,3:00:04.160
movie on paper react oh my god that's so

3:00:01.760,3:00:05.279
funny you said that that's amazing dude

3:00:04.160,3:00:07.040
all right so i'm going to click this and

3:00:05.279,3:00:08.640
it should log us out there we go okay so

3:00:07.040,3:00:10.319
it did log us out all right so we need

3:00:08.640,3:00:11.840
to figure out why i'm not getting that

3:00:10.319,3:00:13.439
picture come through right that's the

3:00:11.840,3:00:15.680
main issue that we have right now so if

3:00:13.439,3:00:17.120
i do proper react or team

3:00:15.680,3:00:19.439
let's go ahead and see it should log me

3:00:17.120,3:00:21.520
in and we should see it come through

3:00:19.439,3:00:23.040
okay so now what i can do is to quickly

3:00:21.520,3:00:27.760
debug this it's fine we can go ahead and

3:00:23.040,3:00:28.800
say console.log and just say user is

3:00:27.760,3:00:30.080
user

3:00:28.800,3:00:32.720
and then let's go ahead and see what's

3:00:30.080,3:00:34.080
happening in the in the terminal user is

3:00:32.720,3:00:35.680
here we go and here we've got a bunch of

3:00:34.080,3:00:36.840
stuff

3:00:35.680,3:00:38.399
photo

3:00:36.840,3:00:41.200
url

3:00:38.399,3:00:44.399
ah that's why okay so it's user.photo

3:00:41.200,3:00:46.399
url so for the photo url it's capital

3:00:44.399,3:00:46.720
right popper is emotional now it's crazy

3:00:46.399,3:00:48.800
right

3:00:46.720,3:00:49.870
[Music]

3:00:48.800,3:00:51.279
so that's why

3:00:49.870,3:00:53.279
[Music]

3:00:51.279,3:00:55.680
and there you go look there it is

3:00:53.279,3:00:57.439
perfect all right that's amazing now at

3:00:55.680,3:00:58.960
this point we've got proper fan we can

3:00:57.439,3:01:01.520
click here and what i want to do is i

3:00:58.960,3:01:04.319
want to send that message as sunny but

3:01:01.520,3:01:05.520
not through like a hard-coded value okay

3:01:04.319,3:01:08.160
so what i want to do is i'm going to go

3:01:05.520,3:01:10.640
to my chat input and remember where we

3:01:08.160,3:01:13.040
sent that message earlier we sent it

3:01:10.640,3:01:14.080
with hard-coded values here okay so now

3:01:13.040,3:01:15.439
we don't want to do hardcore dude

3:01:14.080,3:01:16.319
because why do we need to do hardcoded

3:01:15.439,3:01:18.800
because we actually have the actual

3:01:16.319,3:01:20.319
thing working okay so this is clean i'm

3:01:18.800,3:01:22.720
not even doing this a really clean code

3:01:20.319,3:01:25.680
right now okay so what i'm gonna do now

3:01:22.720,3:01:27.600
is we've got the user being passed no we

3:01:25.680,3:01:29.760
haven't we've got the uh i need to pull

3:01:27.600,3:01:32.000
the user in at the top so i'm gonna go

3:01:29.760,3:01:34.240
ahead and pop the user in like so

3:01:32.000,3:01:36.080
and i'm gonna go ahead and pull the hook

3:01:34.240,3:01:37.600
in and the hook does it very efficiently

3:01:36.080,3:01:39.680
so it's gonna make sure it uses it once

3:01:37.600,3:01:41.359
and it just reuses it car says go thank

3:01:39.680,3:01:42.720
you so much dude let's hit let's hit

3:01:41.359,3:01:44.960
likes man let's go ahead come on i think

3:01:42.720,3:01:45.920
we can hit 750 dude i seriously think we

3:01:44.960,3:01:47.520
can do it

3:01:45.920,3:01:49.120
okay so at this point what we're going

3:01:47.520,3:01:50.640
to do is we're going to go ahead and do

3:01:49.120,3:01:53.439
auth is not defined we need to import

3:01:50.640,3:01:55.520
off there we go save refresh like that

3:01:53.439,3:01:56.880
okay and then the user's name okay so

3:01:55.520,3:01:58.600
for the user's name i'm going to go

3:01:56.880,3:02:00.560
ahead and say

3:01:58.600,3:02:02.160
user.displayname

3:02:00.560,3:02:03.520
for the user's image i'm actually going

3:02:02.160,3:02:06.640
to go ahead and say rather than that one

3:02:03.520,3:02:07.920
was a user.photo url and the best part

3:02:06.640,3:02:10.399
about this is we're just getting this

3:02:07.920,3:02:12.560
information straight from firebase

3:02:10.399,3:02:15.359
so boom if i go ahead and say proper

3:02:12.560,3:02:17.120
farm and i go and say yo

3:02:15.359,3:02:19.600
what's up

3:02:17.120,3:02:21.600
boom look at that guys if i say abc

3:02:19.600,3:02:23.680
it even scrolled me down

3:02:21.600,3:02:25.279
that's clean

3:02:23.680,3:02:27.600
i don't even care what anyone says that

3:02:25.279,3:02:29.520
is so clean that he's like

3:02:27.600,3:02:32.880
he's like i'm proud of that dude that's

3:02:29.520,3:02:35.359
actually a really really good build like

3:02:32.880,3:02:37.359
that's the kind of like uh the sort of

3:02:35.359,3:02:39.680
you know you want that to be you want

3:02:37.359,3:02:42.000
your code to be that level of like

3:02:39.680,3:02:45.120
spotless right so that's like i swear i

3:02:42.000,3:02:46.720
was proud of that one guys 11 likes away

3:02:45.120,3:02:50.080
from 750.

3:02:46.720,3:02:52.319
okay so at this point we have

3:02:50.080,3:02:53.760
our app working in the way we expected

3:02:52.319,3:02:55.680
it to okay everything works in a nice

3:02:53.760,3:02:59.279
way here we can add channels let's go

3:02:55.680,3:02:59.279
and say uh let's just say like uh

3:02:59.600,3:03:04.160
it's a youtube channel okay let's click

3:03:02.479,3:03:04.960
on youtube and then let's go ahead and

3:03:04.160,3:03:07.279
say

3:03:04.960,3:03:08.880
yo what's up youtube

3:03:07.279,3:03:12.160
and you can even put emojis in says drop

3:03:08.880,3:03:13.200
a fire emoji oh oops my

3:03:12.160,3:03:14.319
up in the

3:03:13.200,3:03:16.800
file

3:03:14.319,3:03:18.240
oh okay i guess my rocket crashed yo

3:03:16.800,3:03:19.920
what's up youtube there we go and it

3:03:18.240,3:03:21.840
works right so that looks pretty good

3:03:19.920,3:03:23.760
all right so i'm gonna go ahead deploy

3:03:21.840,3:03:25.600
this in a sec and then we're actually

3:03:23.760,3:03:27.200
gonna go ahead and do this right does

3:03:25.600,3:03:28.800
firebase hook some reactions do the same

3:03:27.200,3:03:30.720
because it actually allows you to go

3:03:28.800,3:03:32.800
ahead and it uses a use effect under the

3:03:30.720,3:03:34.080
hood i actually teach inside of zero to

3:03:32.800,3:03:36.319
full stack hero how to create your own

3:03:34.080,3:03:38.160
hooks really really fun exercise as well

3:03:36.319,3:03:41.359
that we do inside the course remember

3:03:38.160,3:03:43.920
guys two days two days left inside of

3:03:41.359,3:03:45.200
our sale and then we close the doors to

3:03:43.920,3:03:46.880
the community and i don't know when

3:03:45.200,3:03:49.439
we're opening up again but all i know is

3:03:46.880,3:03:52.720
that the energy is untouchable like it

3:03:49.439,3:03:54.800
is the best like that's it period

3:03:52.720,3:03:56.319
right so at this point pretty good i

3:03:54.800,3:03:58.880
think everything here is actually

3:03:56.319,3:04:00.800
perfect in the sense of besides that i

3:03:58.880,3:04:01.760
almost missed that the sidebar

3:04:00.800,3:04:04.399
okay

3:04:01.760,3:04:06.479
so the sidebar at this point the sidebar

3:04:04.399,3:04:07.920
at this point has got a hard-coded name

3:04:06.479,3:04:09.920
we don't want a hardcoded name we want

3:04:07.920,3:04:11.200
the actual name of the user so what i do

3:04:09.920,3:04:12.479
is i just pretty much go ahead and grab

3:04:11.200,3:04:14.080
the user

3:04:12.479,3:04:15.520
and again if we're not using this oh i

3:04:14.080,3:04:17.520
actually have another feature on to do

3:04:15.520,3:04:19.040
the loading state so if i forget remind

3:04:17.520,3:04:20.840
me okay carl says really like that

3:04:19.040,3:04:23.120
scroll to bottom yeah really really cool

3:04:20.840,3:04:26.000
addition now here what i do is i go

3:04:23.120,3:04:29.120
ahead grab the user like so save not

3:04:26.000,3:04:30.399
defined yep i always missed that one

3:04:29.120,3:04:32.640
wait for it and let's go ahead and

3:04:30.399,3:04:34.479
import this and guys by the way if you

3:04:32.640,3:04:36.240
do want access to this code and you feel

3:04:34.479,3:04:39.359
lazy then the second link in the

3:04:36.240,3:04:41.279
description is the link to the papa

3:04:39.359,3:04:43.600
github repo where all of this is

3:04:41.279,3:04:45.840
available now i want to address

3:04:43.600,3:04:48.160
something now did you notice how what

3:04:45.840,3:04:50.399
happened just there i had refreshed the

3:04:48.160,3:04:52.479
page i was logged in already so if i go

3:04:50.399,3:04:54.000
ahead and refresh here i'm already

3:04:52.479,3:04:56.000
actually logged in

3:04:54.000,3:04:57.439
but what's up andy b you guys can't wait

3:04:56.000,3:04:58.640
to watch this back later yeah oh yeah

3:04:57.439,3:05:00.399
dude this really really fun build

3:04:58.640,3:05:02.240
actually so you see when we refresh

3:05:00.399,3:05:04.720
right there's a loading there's a point

3:05:02.240,3:05:07.520
where it's loading and it's not actually

3:05:04.720,3:05:09.279
sort of it hasn't got the user yet all

3:05:07.520,3:05:11.279
right i want to have it so it looks a

3:05:09.279,3:05:13.200
bit like this so look imagine if it

3:05:11.279,3:05:15.279
could look something like this

3:05:13.200,3:05:17.760
that's pretty clean right that's

3:05:15.279,3:05:21.040
actually pretty clean and i want to get

3:05:17.760,3:05:23.120
that working so how do we get this

3:05:21.040,3:05:25.279
in play right because that's clean as

3:05:23.120,3:05:26.720
well right so what i'm gonna do juwan

3:05:25.279,3:05:27.760
says hi sonny thanks for the amazing one

3:05:26.720,3:05:30.640
i'm really learning for the first time

3:05:27.760,3:05:33.920
after years thank you so much dude um so

3:05:30.640,3:05:36.319
what we're to do now is inside of app.js

3:05:33.920,3:05:38.000
right here all right so in app.js so i'm

3:05:36.319,3:05:39.359
going to go to app.js and then here we

3:05:38.000,3:05:41.200
have everything happening we have the

3:05:39.359,3:05:43.520
sort of you know the user notification

3:05:41.200,3:05:45.439
stuff but what i'm going to do now

3:05:43.520,3:05:46.720
is actually have it so remember we

3:05:45.439,3:05:47.760
pulled the loading station so i'm going

3:05:46.720,3:05:49.359
to say okay

3:05:47.760,3:05:51.120
if it's loading

3:05:49.359,3:05:53.840
all right then i'm going to return a

3:05:51.120,3:05:55.040
different bit of jsx oops not that

3:05:53.840,3:05:56.720
yeah if it's i'm going to return a

3:05:55.040,3:05:59.439
different bit of jsx now i'm going to

3:05:56.720,3:06:01.840
create a uploading so i'm going to

3:05:59.439,3:06:03.920
create a uploading container so this is

3:06:01.840,3:06:05.520
going to be a div and inside of it i'm

3:06:03.920,3:06:06.399
going to have uploading contents another

3:06:05.520,3:06:08.720
div

3:06:06.399,3:06:10.000
okay so i'm going to have another div

3:06:08.720,3:06:11.520
and we're going to quickly go ahead and

3:06:10.000,3:06:14.720
set those ones up

3:06:11.520,3:06:16.080
okay so i'm going to do uploading

3:06:14.720,3:06:17.600
let's go ahead and chuck those at the

3:06:16.080,3:06:19.040
bottom let's go ahead and do this to say

3:06:17.600,3:06:21.200
cons

3:06:19.040,3:06:22.560
uploading

3:06:21.200,3:06:24.000
same there we go we've got uploading and

3:06:22.560,3:06:26.560
then we've also got the second one which

3:06:24.000,3:06:28.319
was app loading contents

3:06:26.560,3:06:30.479
these are two styled components and let

3:06:28.319,3:06:31.279
me know hit the thumbs up button if you

3:06:30.479,3:06:32.880
like

3:06:31.279,3:06:34.560
the um

3:06:32.880,3:06:36.720
part is when you can get mine if you

3:06:34.560,3:06:38.880
really like style components i am a fan

3:06:36.720,3:06:41.040
honestly and we didn't even use the most

3:06:38.880,3:06:42.479
powerful thing like the props use case

3:06:41.040,3:06:44.560
right so it's actually extremely really

3:06:42.479,3:06:46.399
powerful sunny best the best go go go

3:06:44.560,3:06:49.279
appreciate it dude five likes away from

3:06:46.399,3:06:51.279
750 wow oh man and you see we didn't

3:06:49.279,3:06:52.880
even actually make full power of a

3:06:51.279,3:06:54.800
reactor we didn't actually use much of

3:06:52.880,3:06:55.520
reactor so you don't actually fully need

3:06:54.800,3:06:57.279
it

3:06:55.520,3:06:58.880
but you guys can i i implemented it

3:06:57.279,3:07:01.439
because i want to make it so you can

3:06:58.880,3:07:02.640
extend on it and by having

3:07:01.439,3:07:04.560
place you guys don't have to ask you

3:07:02.640,3:07:07.439
know how do we have it inside of this we

3:07:04.560,3:07:08.800
just you can pretty much use it okay so

3:07:07.439,3:07:11.200
what i'm going to do now is i'm going to

3:07:08.800,3:07:12.080
go ahead and say now where we have this

3:07:11.200,3:07:14.560
um

3:07:12.080,3:07:16.160
i'm going to go ahead and pop in here

3:07:14.560,3:07:17.200
and then what i'm going to do is inside

3:07:16.160,3:07:19.520
of here i'm going to have an image and

3:07:17.200,3:07:21.840
this is the slack logo now that cool

3:07:19.520,3:07:24.640
little spinner that you just saw this is

3:07:21.840,3:07:26.160
a snack logo by the way so oh

3:07:24.640,3:07:28.880
go ahead and see something okay

3:07:26.160,3:07:32.240
something looks ugly and this is because

3:07:28.880,3:07:33.120
i have not done this one oh there we go

3:07:32.240,3:07:34.880
ah

3:07:33.120,3:07:36.399
scared me for a sec all right so you see

3:07:34.880,3:07:37.520
now there's a huge logo that's kind of

3:07:36.399,3:07:39.200
stuck in the beginning right so we're

3:07:37.520,3:07:41.760
going to fix that in a sec

3:07:39.200,3:07:43.359
but what i want to do is that um

3:07:41.760,3:07:45.760
sunny programming seems so complicated

3:07:43.359,3:07:47.760
in a good way thank you so much dude um

3:07:45.760,3:07:50.319
so here i'm going to actually install

3:07:47.760,3:07:51.680
something called react spin kit okay so

3:07:50.319,3:07:53.520
you guys can check out their docs their

3:07:51.680,3:07:55.439
docs are really cool actually and

3:07:53.520,3:07:57.359
they're very simple the way they explain

3:07:55.439,3:07:59.279
it they show you a bunch of examples but

3:07:57.359,3:08:01.040
it's this guy right here carl matthews

3:07:59.279,3:08:02.720
and he actually shows the use cases in a

3:08:01.040,3:08:03.840
demo screen if you want to check it out

3:08:02.720,3:08:05.840
but right now i'm going to show you how

3:08:03.840,3:08:08.560
to implement it okay come on j to pull

3:08:05.840,3:08:09.920
it up and say yarn add react spring kit

3:08:08.560,3:08:11.279
we're going to go and install that now

3:08:09.920,3:08:14.399
once we've installed that while it's

3:08:11.279,3:08:16.960
doing it i'm going to import spinner

3:08:14.399,3:08:18.479
import spinner from react spin kit

3:08:16.960,3:08:21.040
and then what i'm going to do one

3:08:18.479,3:08:22.160
microwave whoa our sign law says

3:08:21.040,3:08:23.520
something i'm 11 years old can i join

3:08:22.160,3:08:25.120

we get so much support is just unreal i

3:08:42.399,3:08:46.640
don't care man we we don't have

3:08:44.640,3:08:48.319
a hundred thousand subs yet and we are

3:08:46.640,3:08:50.160
crushing channels with hundreds of

3:08:48.319,3:08:51.840
thousands of subs so

3:08:50.160,3:08:54.880
we're killing it dude

confidence will come through we teach a

3:09:49.520,3:09:53.120
lot of this inside the course but it's

3:09:51.359,3:09:54.479
really like honestly anonymous group

3:09:53.120,3:09:56.560

3:09:58.720,3:10:01.200
finally you're back i hope you can

3:09:59.680,3:10:03.200
continue making videos regards thank you

3:10:01.200,3:10:04.960
so much dude appreciate you um so at

3:10:03.200,3:10:06.560
this point now we've got the if loading

3:10:04.960,3:10:08.399
so now okay let's go ahead and refresh

3:10:06.560,3:10:10.399
you see it pops up while it's loading

3:10:08.399,3:10:12.239
but we need to style it now okay so what

3:10:10.399,3:10:13.920
i'm gonna do here is i'm going to go to

3:10:12.239,3:10:15.439
my uploading and i'm actually going to

3:10:13.920,3:10:17.120
make this look a bit cleaner so i'm

3:10:15.439,3:10:19.600
going to go ahead and jump on a few

3:10:17.120,3:10:20.560
things um adam says i've actually

3:10:19.600,3:10:22.000
started

3:10:20.560,3:10:23.040
penning these builds out physically

3:10:22.000,3:10:24.399
instead of building them straight away

3:10:23.040,3:10:26.080
so i can concentrate on why the code is

3:10:24.399,3:10:28.160
used more i've learned so much dude

3:10:26.080,3:10:30.399
that's incredible that's what i'm

3:10:28.160,3:10:32.080
talking about man that's exactly what

3:10:30.399,3:10:33.040
i'm talking about

3:10:32.080,3:10:34.399
so

3:10:33.040,3:10:36.080
look you want to check in text align

3:10:34.399,3:10:37.840
center padding bottom 100 pixels display

3:10:36.080,3:10:40.239
flex flex direction column justify

3:10:37.840,3:10:41.600
content center align item center now

3:10:40.239,3:10:43.359
while you're styling this you don't want

3:10:41.600,3:10:45.279
to keep refreshing and kind of guessing

3:10:43.359,3:10:46.479
okay so what i do is i go to here and i

3:10:45.279,3:10:47.920
say if true

3:10:46.479,3:10:50.080
while it's doing while i'm sort of

3:10:47.920,3:10:51.680
working it out right so if true and then

3:10:50.080,3:10:53.840
it will kind of force the screen to stay

3:10:51.680,3:10:55.279
on right and then i'll just make sure

3:10:53.840,3:10:56.640
you don't leave it like that they say

3:10:55.279,3:10:57.840
image i'm gonna say a height of 100

3:10:56.640,3:11:01.600
pixels

3:10:57.840,3:11:02.880
i'm going to say padding of 20 pixels

3:11:01.600,3:11:05.680
i'm going to save it i'm going to say a

3:11:02.880,3:11:08.800
margin bottom of 40 pixels now as well

3:11:05.680,3:11:12.000
okay so margin 40 oops margin 40.

3:11:08.800,3:11:12.000
and let's go ahead and refresh

3:11:12.319,3:11:16.560
oh no wait a sec

3:11:14.640,3:11:18.720
this is actually this should be in the

3:11:16.560,3:11:20.319
other container this should be over here

3:11:18.720,3:11:22.880
i got it mixed up we should chuck this

3:11:20.319,3:11:24.479
one in the actual contents there we go

3:11:22.880,3:11:26.800
and you see that guys look that's the

3:11:24.479,3:11:28.239
actual loader okay

3:11:26.800,3:11:30.000
please share your working experience i

3:11:28.239,3:11:31.760
do inside the coaching calls i think we

3:11:30.000,3:11:34.000
can complete hit that said it oh hit

3:11:31.760,3:11:35.520
that i think we can hit 800 likes let's

3:11:34.000,3:11:38.960
do it man if we can break eight hundred

3:11:35.520,3:11:40.319
people in this video man crazy right

3:11:38.960,3:11:42.160
anonymous group says something i kill

3:11:40.319,3:11:44.239
this build exactly exactly that's what

3:11:42.160,3:11:45.600
i'm talking about right so i want to add

3:11:44.239,3:11:48.080
a margin bottom because right now it's

3:11:45.600,3:11:49.200
touching it okay so what i'm going to do

3:11:48.080,3:11:50.560
here is i'm going to go to the bottom of

3:11:49.200,3:11:52.560
this and say margin bottom for you and

3:11:50.560,3:11:55.200
it will drop it a little bit away nice

3:11:52.560,3:11:57.120
now how do i get this to center out okay

3:11:55.200,3:11:59.200
so i'm going to do display grid place

3:11:57.120,3:12:01.279
item center height of 100 view height

3:11:59.200,3:12:03.120
and a width of 100 on the uploading

3:12:01.279,3:12:04.560
container okay

3:12:03.120,3:12:06.319
boom save

3:12:04.560,3:12:08.319
and there you go okay now we've got this

3:12:06.319,3:12:10.080
little loader okay now what i can do is

3:12:08.319,3:12:12.319
i can change this boolean back to

3:12:10.080,3:12:15.040
loading so it's no longer forced to true

3:12:12.319,3:12:18.880
and i hit save all right and now check

3:12:15.040,3:12:20.720
this out guys are you ready for this

3:12:18.880,3:12:22.560
boom loading

3:12:20.720,3:12:23.920
while it's loading it's gonna be here

3:12:22.560,3:12:26.880
and then when the user comes it'll go

3:12:23.920,3:12:28.880
ahead and pop us in that's clean i don't

3:12:26.880,3:12:31.439
even care that's so clean it makes me

3:12:28.880,3:12:32.960
excited like you can tell i i can't fake

3:12:31.439,3:12:34.640
this level of excitement right i know

3:12:32.960,3:12:36.800
it's geeky i don't give a crap like that

3:12:34.640,3:12:39.040
is a geek out moment i was just like on

3:12:36.800,3:12:42.399
the other day like this stripe checkout

3:12:39.040,3:12:45.840
team jumped into the netflix challenge i

3:12:42.399,3:12:48.479
blew my mind when i saw that the actual

3:12:45.840,3:12:51.359
stripe checkout team were in the chat

3:12:48.479,3:12:52.640
that's insane man i couldn't believe

3:12:51.359,3:12:54.640
that

3:12:52.640,3:12:56.080
so this is uh styled components not

3:12:54.640,3:12:57.600
regular css we're just doing start

3:12:56.080,3:12:59.200
components and it has a lot of pros and

3:12:57.600,3:13:01.200
cons there's a lot of pros sorry a lot

3:12:59.200,3:13:03.200
of pros okay so i'm gonna go ahead and

3:13:01.200,3:13:04.560
save and now look at this guys we hit

3:13:03.200,3:13:06.880
refresh

3:13:04.560,3:13:08.640
boom nice perfect right and then you

3:13:06.880,3:13:10.640
click on the channel and there you go

3:13:08.640,3:13:13.680
that is so slick that's really really

3:13:10.640,3:13:16.319
nice right so at this point

3:13:13.680,3:13:18.399
guys i think we are i think we're ready

3:13:16.319,3:13:20.319

sunny isn't necessary to learn to tell

3:13:52.239,3:13:56.319
when css

3:13:53.600,3:13:58.880
um i mean it's a new trendy sort of

3:13:56.319,3:14:00.000
thing i'd say right um all right so

3:13:58.880,3:14:02.080
everyone's ready for this right so i'm

3:14:00.000,3:14:04.239
going to show you how to go ahead and

3:14:02.080,3:14:05.840
deploy this okay so

3:14:04.239,3:14:07.040
let's find a quick let's find a nice one

3:14:05.840,3:14:08.239
there we go let's just bring this up

3:14:07.040,3:14:10.560
this is good

3:14:08.239,3:14:11.760
so to deploy your app right so what

3:14:10.560,3:14:14.720
you're going to do is you're going to go

3:14:11.760,3:14:16.319
ahead and pop up in your terminal

3:14:14.720,3:14:18.239
and here i'm going to go ahead and say

3:14:16.319,3:14:19.840
firebase login so the first thing you

3:14:18.239,3:14:21.200
want to do is log in okay now i've

3:14:19.840,3:14:22.960
already logged in so i don't need to do

3:14:21.200,3:14:25.120
this but you need to go ahead and say

3:14:22.960,3:14:27.520
firebase login first the next step is

3:14:25.120,3:14:29.279
going to be firebase init okay now

3:14:27.520,3:14:31.520
firebase init basically goes ahead and

3:14:29.279,3:14:33.120
sets up your application with firebase

3:14:31.520,3:14:34.560
okay so this is just a huge terminal

3:14:33.120,3:14:36.080
right now so what we're going to do here

3:14:34.560,3:14:39.520
is i'm going to go ahead and go down

3:14:36.080,3:14:40.560
with the arrow keys to hosting okay now

3:14:39.520,3:14:41.680
you can see you've got a bunch of other

3:14:40.560,3:14:42.720
stuff here but we're interested in

3:14:41.680,3:14:44.880
hosting today so we're going to click

3:14:42.720,3:14:46.319
hosting on the spacebar and enter now

3:14:44.880,3:14:48.160
you're going to click use an existing

3:14:46.319,3:14:49.680
project okay so i'm going to click that

3:14:48.160,3:14:52.800
and then we should see a list of our

3:14:49.680,3:14:55.120
projects inside of this account right so

3:14:52.800,3:14:57.200
at this point the one that we created

3:14:55.120,3:14:58.399
right now was actually going to go ahead

3:14:57.200,3:15:00.319
and say you guys can see all these

3:14:58.399,3:15:02.239
builds that i've done it's crazy uh

3:15:00.319,3:15:04.399
right now we have the slack clone right

3:15:02.239,3:15:06.000
and this slack clone youtube all right

3:15:04.399,3:15:08.080
so i'm going to go ahead and hit that

3:15:06.000,3:15:10.160
one and then here what do you want to

3:15:08.080,3:15:13.120
use as your public directory this is

3:15:10.160,3:15:14.640
extremely important do not mess this up

3:15:13.120,3:15:16.640
all right if you do do firebase in it

3:15:14.640,3:15:17.920
and do the whole step again right but at

3:15:16.640,3:15:19.359
this point

3:15:17.920,3:15:21.439
what you're going to do is and guys in

3:15:19.359,3:15:23.680
the meantime i wonder if we can break

3:15:21.439,3:15:25.760
800 likes by the time we deploy how

3:15:23.680,3:15:27.359
crazy would that be let's do it if we

3:15:25.760,3:15:29.200
finish it we'll finish this on such a

3:15:27.359,3:15:31.120
high man oh in the public direction

3:15:29.200,3:15:33.359
we're typing build okay so it's going to

3:15:31.120,3:15:35.200
be build right so i'm going to hit build

3:15:33.359,3:15:37.120
and then configure it as a single page

3:15:35.200,3:15:40.960
app yeah so you're going to click yes

3:15:37.120,3:15:42.640
with a y okay so undo this boom save and

3:15:40.960,3:15:44.720
then set up automatic bills and deploy

3:15:42.640,3:15:47.040
we get up no we're not going to do that

3:15:44.720,3:15:48.399
and then it sets up okay the next step

3:15:47.040,3:15:51.520
yes you guys have started guessing it

3:15:48.399,3:15:52.880
right now we're gonna do mpm run build

3:15:51.520,3:15:54.479
or you can do yarn build it doesn't

3:15:52.880,3:15:56.880
really matter at this point right but

3:15:54.479,3:15:59.040
npm run build now important step what

3:15:56.880,3:16:00.479
this does is it basically goes ahead and

3:15:59.040,3:16:02.160
there's loads of things when we build

3:16:00.479,3:16:04.880
our like hot reloading and a bunch of

3:16:02.160,3:16:07.040
other stuff right we don't always need

3:16:04.880,3:16:08.319
that in the final production build we

3:16:07.040,3:16:09.439
don't even need in the final production

3:16:08.319,3:16:11.520
build because our customers aren't

3:16:09.439,3:16:13.520
developers they just need the fastest

3:16:11.520,3:16:15.359
app so we basically trim out all the fat

3:16:13.520,3:16:16.800
of the app and then we basically go

3:16:15.359,3:16:19.359
ahead and

3:16:16.800,3:16:21.279
create an optimized production build and

3:16:19.359,3:16:22.399
as you can see here it says pretty much

3:16:21.279,3:16:24.720
we're going to go ahead and create an

3:16:22.399,3:16:27.120
optimized production build so once this

3:16:24.720,3:16:30.239
is done it will basically bundle up our

3:16:27.120,3:16:32.800
application into a lovely folder over

3:16:30.239,3:16:35.120
here called build okay now something

3:16:32.800,3:16:37.120
important to know you do not touch the

3:16:35.120,3:16:38.160
build folder pretty much okay so you

3:16:37.120,3:16:40.479
don't really mess around with the build

3:16:38.160,3:16:43.120
photo and instead the way you need to do

3:16:40.479,3:16:44.560
it is that if you touch any of your code

3:16:43.120,3:16:48.000
after it's gone ahead and finished

run build again because it it would be

3:16:51.279,3:16:54.720
your build would not have the latest
